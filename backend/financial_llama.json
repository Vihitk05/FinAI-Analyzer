G ains and losses on dispos als are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount . These are recognised within âĢ ĺ other income / exp enses âĢ Ļ in profit or loss . Int angible assets Int angible assets are stated at cost less accumulated am ort isation and impairment losses . The cost of computer software is am ort ised over 3 years . An assessment of am ort isation method and useful lives is undertaken at each reporting date and , where material , if there is a change in estimate , an appropriate adjustment is made to the am ort isation charge . Int angible assets with indefinite useful lives are not am ort ised as the Company does not identify any foreseeable limit on the benefits embodied with such rights . Consequently , these are tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses . Imp air ment of tangible and intangible assets At each reporting date , the management reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets ( including right - of - use assets ) and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss . If any such indication exists , the recover able amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any . Where it is not possible to estimate the recover able amount of an individual asset , the acquire r estimates the recover able amount of the cash - gener ating unit to which the asset belongs . Recover able amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value - in - use . In assessing value - in - use , the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset . If the recover able amount of an asset ( or cash - gener ating unit ) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount , the carrying amount of the asset ( cash - gener ating unit ) is reduced to its recover able amount . An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss , unless the relevant asset is carried at a re valued amount , in which case the impairment loss is treated as a re val uation decrease .

( 08 ) of 2017 , Value Added Tax ( V AT ), is charged at 5 % standard rate or 0 % ( as the case may be ) on every taxable supply and deemed supply made by the taxable person . The Company charges and recovers Value Added Tax ( V AT ) on every taxable supply and deemed supply , in accordance with the applicable commercial VAT laws . Ir re cover able VAT for which Company cannot avail the credit is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in costs of non - current assets . The Company files its VAT returns and comp utes the payable tax ( which is output tax less input tax ) for the allotted tax periods and deposits the same within the prescribed due dates of filing VAT return and tax payment . VAT rece ivable and VAT Pay able are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position as the Company has a legally enforce able right to offset the recognised amounts and has the intention to settle the same on net basis . Income and deferred tax Tax expense comprises of current tax and deferred tax . Current tax is measured by the amount of tax expected to be paid to the taxation authorities on the taxable profits after considering tax allowances and exemptions and using applicable tax rates and laws . Def erred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the accounting base and the tax base for the year and quant ified using the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substant ively enacted as on the balance sheet date . Def erred tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach . Def erred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements , except when the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the transaction . Def erred tax asset is recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences , and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be util ised . Def erred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences . Current tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforce able right to set off the recognised amount and there is an intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L .

Provision for staff end of services benefits are disclosed as non - current liability . Provision is also made for employees âĢ Ļ entitlement to annual leave salary and air passage for eligible employees as per the policy of the Company . Provision relating to annual leave salary and air passage is disclosed as current liability as employees are entitled to redeem these benefits at any point of time after the reporting period . Def ined contribution plan U . A . E national employees of the Company are members of the Government - managed retirement pension and social security benefit scheme pursuant to Federal Labour Law no . 7 of 1999 and Federal Labour Law no . 52 of 2022 . The Company is required to contribute 12 . 5 % of the âĢ ľ cont ribution calculation salary âĢ Ŀ of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits . The employees registered prior to 31 October 20 23 are required to contribute 5 % of the âĢ ľ cont ribution calculation salary âĢ Ŀ to the scheme whereas the employees registered after 31 October 20 23 for the first time with General Pension and Social Security Authority ( G PS SA ) shall contribute 11 %. The Government contributes 2 . 5 % of the âĢ ľ cont ribution calculation salary âĢ Ŀ to the scheme . The only obligation of the Company with respect to the retirement pension and social security scheme is to make the specified contributions . The contributions are charged to profit or loss . Stat utory reserve In accordance with the U . A . E . Federal Law No . 32 of 2021 on Commercial Companies , the Company is required to establish a statutory reserve by appropriation of 5 % of net profit until the reserve equals 50 % of the share capital . The shareholders may resolve to discontin ue such deduction when the reserve totals 50 % of the paid - up share capital . The reserve is not available for distribution except as provided in the Federal Law . During the year , no transfer of statutory reserve has been made on account of loss incurred by the Company . Revenue recognition The Company is in the business of trading of jew ellery , watches , spect acles and precious stones . Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer at \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 1 . Ident ify the contracts with customers : A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforce able rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met . 2 . Ident ify the performance obligations in the contract : A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a goods to the customer . 3 . Deter mine the transaction price : The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer , excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties . 4 . All ocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract : For a contract that has more than one performance obligation , the Company will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation . 5 . Recogn ise revenue when ( or as ) the Company satisfies a performance obligation at a point in time or over time . The Company satisfies a performance obligation and recogn ises revenue over time , if one of the following criteria is met : e The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company âĢ Ļ s performance as the Company performs ; or e The Company âĢ Ļ s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced ; or e The Company âĢ Ļ s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforce able right to payment for performance completed to date . The Company is required to assess each of its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time in order to determine the appropriate method of recogn ising revenue . Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer , generally on delivery of the goods . Revenue is measured based on the transaction price , which is the consideration , net of customer incentives , discounts , variable considerations , payments made to customers , other similar charges . Additionally , revenue excludes taxes collected from customers , which are subsequently rem itted to governmental authorities . Interest income Interest income is recognised as the interest acc ru es using the effective interest method , under which the rate used exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset . \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L .

R ental contracts are typically made for period ranging from 1 to 5 years but may have extension options . Le ase terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions . The lease arrangements do not impose any covenant , however leased assets are not used as security for borrowing purposes . Right - of - use assets The Company recogn ises right - of - use assets at the date the underlying asset is available for use . Right - of - use assets are measured at cost , less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses , and adjusted for any reimbursement of lease liabilities . The cost of right - of - use assets includes : = the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability ; \" any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received ; and = any initial costs and = restoration costs . Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term , the recognised right - of - use assets are dep reci ated on a straight - line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term . Right - of - use assets are subject to impairment . Le ase liabilities The Company recogn ises lease liabilities at the commencement date of the lease . The lease liabilities are measured at the net present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term . The lease payments include : Â» fixed payments ( including in - sub st ance fixed payments ), less any lease incentives rece ivable ; = variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate ; = amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees ; = the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company ; and = payments of penalties for terminating the lease , if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate . The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate in calculating the present value of lease payments and uses the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease if the profit rate implicit in the lease is not readily determin able . Further , the carrying amount of lease liabilities is rem eas ured if there is a modification , a change in the lease term , a change in the in - sub st ance lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset .

The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period . Short - term leases The Company applies the short - term lease recognition exemption to its short - term leases ( i . e ., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option ). Le ase payments on short - term leases are recognised as expense on a straight - line basis over the lease term . Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash on hand and bank current accounts . Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into UAE Dir ham s at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transactions . Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into UAE Dir ham s at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date . G ains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are taken to profit or loss . B orrow ing costs B orrow ing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred except those that are attributable to the acquisition and construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period to get ready for its intended use ( âĢ ľ qual ifying asset âĢ Ŀ ). Such borrowing costs are capital ised as part of the related qualifying asset up to the date the qualifying asset is ready for use . Prov isions General A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation ( legal or constructive ) as a result of a past event , it is probable that an out flow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation . The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation . Where a provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation , its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows . When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party , the rece ivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of rece ivable can be measured reliably .

It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the next financial year . Ass um ptions used to calculate the provision for warranties were based on current sales levels and current information available about returns based on the warranty period for all goods sold . Cont ing encies and commitments Cont ing ent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements . They are disclosed unless the possibility of an out flow of resources embod ying economic benefits is remote . A contingent asset is not recognised in the financial statements but disclosed when an inf low of economic benefits is probable . Current versus non - current classification The Company presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current / non - current classification . An asset is current when it is : e Ex pected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle . Â© Held primarily for the purpose of trading . e Ex pected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period . or , e Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period . All other assets are classified as non - current . A liability is current when : e It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle . e It is held primarily for the purpose of trading . e It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period . or , e There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period . The Company class ifies all other liabilities as non - current . Financial instruments Classification On initial recognition , a financial asset is classified as measured at : am ort ised cost ; debt investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ; equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ; or fair value through profit or loss . The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets âĢ Ļ contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company âĢ Ļ s business model for managing them . Page 20 of 43 \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at am ort ised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income , it needs to give rise to cash flows that are âĢ ĺ sole ly payments of principal and interest âĢ Ļ on the principal amount outstanding . This assessment is referred to as the solely payments of principal and interest test and is performed at an instrumental level . The Company âĢ Ļ s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows . The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows , selling the financial assets , or both . Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or at am ort ised cost . The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition . Recogn ition Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when , and only when , the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument . Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade - date , the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset . D ere c ogn ition Financial assets are de - recogn ised when , and only when , e The contractual rights to receive cash flows expire or e The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a âĢ ĺ pass - through âĢ Ļ arrangement ; and either ( a ) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset , or ( b ) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset , but has transferred control of the asset . Financial liabilities are de - recogn ised when , and only when , they are extinguished i . e ., when obligation specified in the contract is discharged , cancelled or expired . Measure ment A financial asset ( unless it is a trade rece ivable without a significant financing component that is initially measured at the transaction price ) is initially measured at fair value plus , for an item not at fair value through profit or loss , transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition . Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are exp ensed in profit and loss . All financial assets not classified as measured at am ort ised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss . This includes \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities . Financial assets Financial assets at am ort ised cost Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at am ort ised cost less impairment loss and deferred income , if any ( except for those assets that are designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition ) using the effective interest method . 1 . the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows ; and 2 . the contractual terms of the instrument give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and profit on the principal amount outstanding . All other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value . Foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss . Any gain or loss on de recogn ition is recognised in profit or loss . The financial assets at am ort ised cost comprise of trade and other rece iv ables , due from related parties , cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets . Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss . This category includes derivative instruments . Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at am ort ised cost using the effective interest method or at fair value through profit or loss . Financial liabilities at am ort ised cost Financial liabilities at am ort ised cost comprise of trade and other pay ables , lease liabilities ( current and non - current ), due to related parties , other financial liabilities and borrow ings ( short - term and long - term ). Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hed ging relationship .

C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss consists of derivative financial liabilities Imp air ment of financial assets The Company recogn ises an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss . Ex pected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive , discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate . The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms . Loss allowances are measured on either of the following basis : âĢĶ 12 - month expected credit loss : expected credit loss that result from possible default events within 12 months after the reporting date ; and âĢĶ Lifetime expected credit loss : expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument . The Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses , except for the following which are measured as 12 - month expected credit losses : âĢĶ Bank balances , other financial assets and other rece iv ables for which credit risk ( i . e ., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument ) has not increased significantly since initial recognition . The Company has elected to measure loss allowances for trade rece iv ables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses . The Company applies a simplified approach in calculating expected credit losses . The Company does not track changes in credit risk , but instead recogn ises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date . The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience , adjusted for forward - looking factors specific to the debt ors and the economic environment . When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses , the Company considers reasonable and supportive information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort . This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis , based on the Company âĢ Ļ s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information . The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due . Page 23 of 43 \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 r ) The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when : âĢĶ The customer is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full , without recourse by the Company to actions such as real ising security ( if any is held ); or âĢĶ The financial asset is more than 365 days past due . The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk . At each reporting date , the Company assess es whether financial assets carried at am ort ised cost are credit - im pa ired . A financial asset is âĢ ĺ credit - im pa ired âĢ Ļ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have occurred . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at am ort ised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the asset . For financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income , the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income , instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset . Off setting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforce able right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis , or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously . Equity Share capital is recorded at the value of proceeds received towards interest in share capital of the Company . Der iv atives financial instruments Der iv atives that qualify for hedge accounting The management has applied hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments . The management applies hedge accounting only if all of the following conditions are met : e There is formal designation and written documentation at the inception of the hedge ; e The effectiveness of the hed ging relationship can be measured reliably . This requires the fair value of the hed ging instrument , and the fair value or cash flows of the hed ged item with respect to the risk being hed ged , to be reliably measurable ; e The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving fair value or cash flow offsets in accordance with the original documented risk management strategy ; and e The hedge is assessed and determined to be highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the hedge relationship . A hedge is highly effective if changes in the fair value of the hed ging instrument , and changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the hed ged item attributable to the hed ged risk . Page 24 of 43 \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 s ) The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations . The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk . At inception of the hedge , the management design ates hedge either as a cash flow hedge or as a fair value hedge . The designation is done at inception of the hedge . At inception of the hedge , the management establishes formal documentation of the hedge relationship . The method an entity adop ts depends on its risk management strategy and hedge accounting systems and practices . The method that will be used in measuring hedge effectiveness is specified in the hedge documentation . The hedge documentation prepared at inception includes a description of the following : e Risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge ; e The nature of the risk being hed ged ; e Clear identification of the hed ged item the asset , liability , firm commitment or cash flows arising from a forecast transaction and the hed ging instrument ; and e How hedge effectiveness will be assessed both prospect ively and retrospect ively . The entity describes the method and procedures in sufficient detail to establish a firm and consistent basis for measurement in subsequent periods for the particular hedge . A hed ging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements if there is an economic relationship between the hed ged item and the hed ging instrument , the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from the economic relationship and the hedge ratio of the hed ging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantities of the hed ged item that the entity actually hed ges and the hed ging instrument used to hedge that quantity of hed ged item . In a fair value hedge , any in effect iveness is automatically recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because changes in the measurement of both the hed ging instrument and the hed ged item are reported through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except if the hed ging instrument hed ges an equity investment for which the management has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income . Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments , such as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at fair value at each reporting date . The Company also discl oses the fair value of financial instruments measured at am ort ised cost . The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L . C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 e Int he principal market for the asset or liability or e In the absence of a principal market , in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability . The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using assumptions that the market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability , assuming that the market participants act in their best economic interests . The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value , maxim ising the use of relevant observable inputs and minim ising the use of unob serv able inputs . In addition , the fair value measurements are categor ised into Level 1 , 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurement are observable and significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety , which are described as follows : e Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices ( un adjusted ) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities . e Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ( i . e . as prices ) or indirectly ( i . e . derived from prices ). e Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data ( un ob serv able inputs ). 4 . SIGN IFIC ANT J UD G EMENT S EM PL OY ED IN AP PL YING ACC OUNT ING POL IC IES The significant jud gements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows : Classification of financial assets The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset âĢ Ļ s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company âĢ Ļ s business model for managing them . Imp air ment At each reporting date , management conducts an assessment of property , plant and equipment ( including right - of - use assets ) and intangible assets to determine whether there are any indications that they may be impaired . In the absence of such indications , no further action is taken . If such indications do exist , an analysis of each asset is undertaken to determine its net recover able amount and , if this is below its carrying amount , a provision is made .

C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 SS The Company applies expected credit loss model to measure loss allowance in case of financial assets on the basis of 12 - month expected credit loss or Lifetime expected credit loss depending on credit risk characteristics and how changes in economic factors affect expected credit loss , which are determined on a probability - weight ed basis . Le ases D etermin ing the lease term The Company determines the lease term as the non - c ance ll able term of the lease , together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised , or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease , if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised . The Company has the option , under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional years . The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew . The Company considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal . After the commencement date , the Company reass esses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise ( or not to exercise ) the option to renew . Discount ing of lease payments The lease payments are discounted using the Company âĢ Ļ s incremental borrowing rate ( âĢ ľ IB R âĢ Ŀ ), which ranges from 4 . 11 % to 6 . 40 %, due to the absence of implicit rates in the lease contracts . Management has applied judgments and estimates to determine the I BR , using borrowing rates that certain financial institutions would charge the Company against financing the different types of assets it leases over different terms and different ranges of values . I BR is further adjusted for Company âĢ Ļ s specific risk , term risk and underlying asset risk . Majority of the leases are present in the UAE and accordingly no adjustment for the economic environment was deemed required . Recogn ition of revenue and allocation of transaction price Identification of performance obligations The Company determined that the sale of goods is provided as a single component to customers and accordingly it becomes single performance obligation in respect of the goods being sold . Deter mine timing of satisfaction of performance obligation For sale of goods to retail customers , revenue is recognised when control of the goods has transferred , being at the point the customer purchases the goods at the retail outlet . Payment of the transaction price is due immediately at the point the customer purchases the goods The company concluded that the revenue from sales of goods is to be recognised at a \n\n\n TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L .

This process of risk management is critical to the Company âĢ Ļ s continuing profitability . The Company âĢ Ļ s risk management foc uss es on actively securing short to medium term cash flows by minim ising the exposure to financial markets . The primary risks to which the business is exposed , which are unchanged from the previous year , comprise credit risks , liquidity risks and market risks ( including cash flow interest rate risks and fair value interest rate risks ). The management of the Company reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summar ised below : Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss . Credit risk is managed by assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers and the Potential for exposure to the market in which they operate , combined with regular monitoring and follow - up . The Company buys and sells goods and services in foreign currencies . Exposure is minim ised where possible by den om inating such transactions in US dollars to which the UAE Dir ham s is pegged .

C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 Financial assets that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally bank accounts , trade and other rece iv ables and amount due from related parties . The Company âĢ Ļ s bank accounts are placed with high credit quality financial institutions . B orrow ing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure that the Company ob tains the best available pricing , terms and conditions on its borrow ings . The management assess es the credit risk arising from trade and other rece iv ables and related parties taking into account their financial position , past experience and other factors . Based on the assessment individual risk limits are determined . At the reporting date , 99 % of trade rece iv ables was due from two customers ( pre vious year 58 % of trade rece iv ables was due from one customer ). At the reporting date , the Company âĢ Ļ s trade rece ivable balances are from customers engaged in similar business in which the Company operates . The Company uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade rece iv ables , which comprise a number of balances . Loss rates are calculated using a âĢ ĺ flow rate âĢ Ļ method based on the probability of a rece ivable progressing through successive stages of delinqu ency to write - off . Flow rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the following common credit risk characteristics âĢĶ - geographic region , age of customer relationship and type of product purchased . Based on the assessment , the management believes that no impairment provision is required under IF RS 9 . Liquid ity risk Liquid ity risk is the risk that the Company may encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds . The Company 's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mism atches of the m atur ities of financial assets and financial liabilities . The Company âĢ Ļ s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure , as far as possible , that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due , under both normal and stressed conditions , without inc urring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group âĢ Ļ s reputation . The Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities . The table below summar ises the m atur ities of the Company âĢ Ļ s und isc ount ed financial liabilities at the reporting date , based on contractual payment dates and current market interest rates .

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters , while optimizing the returns . Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the values of financial instruments will fluct uate because of changes in foreign exchange rates . There are no significant currency risks as substantially all financial assets and financial liabilities are den ominated in UAE Dir ham s or US Dollars to which the Dir ham is fixed . Reason ably possible changes to exchange rates at the reporting date are unlikely to have had a significant impact on profit or equity . Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluct uate because of changes in market interest rates . Bank overd raft and bank loan are subject to floating interest rates at levels generally obtained in the UAE or are linked to SO FR and are therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk . At the reporting date , if interest rates had been 1 % higher or lower , interest expense on variable rate debt would have been A ED 3 , 355 , 133 higher or lower ( pre vious year A ED 1 , 216 , 8 18 resulting in equity being lower or higher by A ED 3 , 355 , 133 ( pre vious year A ED 1 , 216 , 8 18 ). 29 .

In our opinion , the accompanying financial statements present fairly , in all material respects , the financial position of Black Sea Trade and Development Bank as at 31 December 2021 , and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IF RS s ). Bas is for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Aud iting ( IS As ) as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation . Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the âĢ ľ Aud itor 's Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements âĢ Ŀ section of our report . We have been independent of the Bank during the whole period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Account ants âĢ Ļ Code of Ethics for Professional Account ants ( IES BA Code ) as incorporated into Greek legislation and the ethical requirements in Greece relevant to the audit of the financial statements and we have fulfilled our ethical requirements in accordance with the applicable legislation and the above mentioned Code of Ethics . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . Em phasis of Matter We draw your attention to note 28 of the financial statements where it is described the negative impact of the geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and Russia , that begun in February 2022 , on the quality of some of the Bank âĢ Ļ s assets . Our report is not qualified in respect to this matter . Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that , in our professional judgment , were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year . These matters and the assessed risks of material mis stat ements were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole , and in forming our opinion there on , and we do not provide a separate \n\n\n Del o itte . Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Ex pected Credit Loss on Loans at am ort ized cost Loans at am ort ized cost of the Bank amounted to EUR 2 , 329 million as at 31 December 2021 ( E UR 2 , 030 million as at 31 December 2020 ) and loss impairment to EUR 44 million ( E UR 56 million as at 31 December 2020 ) as presented on the Statement of Financial Position . The Bank measures Ex pected Credit Loss es ( EC L ) for loans at am ort ized cost both on an individual and a collective basis . The estimation of E CL on loans at am ort ized cost is considered a key audit matter as it is a complex calculation that involves the use of a number of assumptions and parameters such as probability of default ( PD ), Loss Given Default ( LG D ) and Exposure at Default ( E AD ) as well as assumptions around the inputs used and probability weight of the multiple economic scenarios . Significant Management jud gements also relates to the criteria used for the staging assessment of loans at am ort ized cost . Management provided further information about principles and accounting policies for determining the allowance for impairment on loans at am ort ized cost and the management of credit risk in notes 3 . 6 , 5 , 12 and 15 to the financial statements . Based on our risk assessment and following a risk based approach , we have evaluated the impairment method ologies applied and assumptions made by Management in relation to this key audit matter , which included , inter al ia , the following audit procedures : - we obtained an understanding of the procedures and evaluated the design and implementation of relevant internal controls within the business process . - we assessed the appropri at eness of the Bank âĢ Ļ s IF RS 9 impairment method ologies . - with the support of our internal financial risk modeling specialists we assessed the reason abl eness of Management 's assumptions and input data used in the model , including the analysis of the forecast ed macro economic variables . We tested the mechanical elements of the calculations such as the E AD , the PD and stage allocation and reper formed the calculation of the E CL on a sample basis . - we tested the accuracy and comple teness of critical data used in the E CL calculation by agreeing a sample of E CL calculation data points to source systems or documentation . - on as ample basis we assessed the reason abl eness of the estimated expected credit loss for the individually assessed credit impaired exposures . We assessed the adequ acy and comple teness of the Bank âĢ Ļ s disclosures in respect of credit risk , structure and quality of loan portfolio and impairment allowance in accordance with IF RS \n\n\n Del o itte . Respons ibilities of Management and Those Charg ed with Govern ance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IF RS s , and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material mis statement , whether due to fraud or error . In preparing the financial statements , Management is responsible for assessing the Bank âĢ Ļ s ability to continue as a going concern , disclosing , as applicable , matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquid ate the Bank or to cease operations , or has no realistic alternative but to do so . The Audit Committee of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial reporting process . Auditor âĢ Ļ s Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material mis statement , whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditor âĢ Ļ s report that includes our opinion . Re asonable assurance is a high level of assurance , but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with IS As , as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation , will always detect a material mis statement when it exists . Mis stat ements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if , individually or in the aggregate , they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements . As part of an audit in accordance with IS As , as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation , we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit . We also : e Ident ify and assess the risks of material mis statement of the financial statements , whether due to fraud or error , design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks , and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material mis statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error , as fraud may involve collusion , for gery , intentional o missions , misrepresent ations , or the override of internal control . e Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances , but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank 's internal control . e Eval uate the appropri at eness of accounting policies used and the reason abl eness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management . Â° Con clude on the appropri at eness of Management 's use \n\n\n Del o itte . We communicate with those charged with governance regarding , among other matters , the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings , including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit . We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence , and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence , and where applicable , related safeguards . From the matters communicated with those charged with governance , we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters .

The Bank âĢ Ļ s presentation currency is the EUR and values are rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated . Use of Estimates and Jud gments The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IF RS requires management to make judgments and use of estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period .

SIGN IFIC ANT ACC OUNT ING POL IC IES A summary of the Bank âĢ Ļ s accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are presented in this section . These policies are the same as those applied for the comparative period presented taking into account the amendments to standards which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IAS B ), which are further analyzed below : 3 . 1 Ad option of New and Am ended Standards ( IF RS ) New standards and amendments to standards which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IAS B ), applied on 1 January 2021 : I AS 1 : Present ation of Financial Statements I AS 1 sets out the overall requirements for financial statements , including how they should be structured , the minimum requirements for their content and overriding concepts such as going concern , the acc ru al basis of accounting and the current / non - current distinction . The standard requires a complete set of financial statements to comprise a statement of financial position , a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income , a statement of changes in equity and a statement of cash flows . Effective 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 20 23 . Earlier application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . I AS 8 : Accounting Policies , Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors I AS 8 is applied in selecting and applying accounting policies , accounting for changes in estimates and reflecting corrections of prior period errors . The standard requires compliance with any specific IF RS applying to a transaction , event or condition , and provides guidance on developing accounting policies for other items that result in relevant and reliable information . Changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors are generally retrospect ively accounted for , whereas changes in accounting estimates are generally accounted for on a prospective basis . Effective i January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 20 23 . Earlier application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . I AS 12 : Income Taxes I AS 12 implements a so - called ' com pre hens ive balance sheet method ' of accounting for income taxes which recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an entity 's assets and liabilities . Differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities , and carried forward tax losses and credits , are recognized , with limited exceptions \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . Â° I AS 37 : Prov isions , Cont ing ent Li abilities and Cont ing ent Assets I AS 37 outlines the accounting for provisions ( li abilities of uncertain timing or amount ), together with contingent assets ( p ossible assets ) and contingent liabilities ( p ossible obligations and present obligations that are not probable or not reliably measurable ). Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . e I AS 41 : Agriculture I AS 41 sets out the accounting for agricultural activity âĢĶ the transformation of biological assets ( living plants and animals ) into agricultural produce ( har vest ed product of the entity 's biological assets ). The standard generally requires biological assets to be measured at fair value less costs to sell . Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is permitted . The adoption will not have any impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . e IF RS 1 : First - time Ad option of International Financial Reporting Standards IF RS 1 sets out the procedures that an entity must follow when it adop ts IF RS for the first time as the basis for preparing its general purpose financial statements . The IF RS grants limited exemptions from the general requirement to comply with each IF RS effective at the end of its first IF RS reporting period . Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is perm itte d . The adoption will not have any impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . Â° IF RS 3 : Business Comb inations IF RS 3 outlines the accounting when an acquire r ob tains control of a business ( e . g . an acquisition or merger ). Such business combinations are accounted for using the âĢ ĺ acqu isition method ', which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 2 Foreign Cur rencies Translation Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in EUR by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the EUR and the foreign currency at the rate prevailing at the date of transaction . When preparing the financial statements exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities den ominated in foreign currencies at year end are recognized in the income statement . Monetary assets and liabilities den ominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro at the exchange rate at the reporting date . The foreign exchange gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the am ort ized cost in Euro at the beginning of the year , adjusted for the effective interest , impairment and prep ay ments during the year , and the am ort ized cost in the foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year . Non - mon etary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction . Foreign currency differences are generally recognized in income statement except for foreign exchange differences on non - mon etary items which are at F VT OC I as equity investments which are recognized in other comprehensive income . The Bank uses the official exchange rates published for the EUR by the European Central Bank ( EC B ). The exchange rates used by the Bank at the financial position date were as follows . 31 December 31 December 2021 2020 = United States dollar 1 . 132 60 1 . 227 10 = Pound sterling 0 . 840 28 0 . 899 03 = Russian rub le 85 . 300 40 91 . 467 10 1 E UR = Azerbaijan man at 1 . 9 26 50 2 . 08 900 = Georgian l ari 3 . 50 400 4 . 023 30 = Armenian dram 5 42 . 61 000 6 41 . 11 000 = Romanian le u 4 . 949 00 4 . 8 68 30 3 . 3 Cash and Cash Equ ival ents For the purposes of the statement of cash flows , cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand , plac ements with other financial institutions and debt securities with m atur ities of three months or less from the financial position date . These are highly liquid assets that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in value due to the movements in market rates . 3 . 4 Recogn ition and Initial Measure ment , and D ere c ogn ition of Financial Instruments The Bank recognizes a financial asset or financial liability in its statement of financial position when it becomes a party to the contractual rights or obligations . 3 . 4 . 1 . Date of recognition Financial assets and liabilities , with \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 5 3 . 4 . 2 Date of de recogn ition The Bank de recogn izes a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset when ( i ) the contractual rights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire , ( ii ) loses control of the contractual rights that comprise the financial asset or a portion of the financial asset or ( i ) the Bank retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset , but has assumed the obligation to pay it in full without material delay to a third party under a âĢ ĺ pass through âĢ Ļ arrangement . The Bank de recogn izes a financial liability when a liability is extinguished , that is when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged , cancelled or expires . The evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership preced es the evaluation of the transfer of control for de recogn ition transactions . On de recogn ition of a financial asset , the difference between the carrying amount of the asset ( or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset de recogn ized ) and the sum of ( i ) the consideration received ( including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed ) and ( ii ) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OC I is recognized in income statement . Any cumulative gain or loss recognized in OC I in respect of equity investment securities designated as at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ( F VT OC I ) is not recognized in income statement on de recogn ition of such securities . Financial Assets The classification of financial assets defines how existing information is reflected in the financial statements . In particular , the valuation method and the impairment calculation are defined by this classification , which are based on criteria established by the Bank . 3 . 5 . 1 Classification and subsequent measurement The Bank class ifies a financial asset in its financial statements in one of the below three measurement categories : 1 . Financial assets measured at am ort ized cost ( AC ): this category includes each asset or group of assets for which the Bank 's business model constitutes its holding for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows . Financial assets are classified at AC only if both of the following criteria are met : - The objective of the Bank âĢ Ļ s business model is to hold financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows ; and - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding : The Bank includes in this category financial assets which are non - der iv ative with fixed or determin able payments and with fixed m atur ities meeting the above criteria . \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements F VT OC I debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses that arise from fluctuations in fair value recognized in OC I . Their fair value is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices . On de recogn ition cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OC I are re classified from OC I to income statement . Foreign exchange gains or losses and interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognized in income statement . All such financial assets are recognized on trade date . The Ex pected Credit Loss es ( EC L ) for debt instruments measured at F V OC I do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position , which remains at fair value . Instead , an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at am ort ized cost is recognized in OC I as an accumulated impairment amount , with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss . The accumulated loss recognized in OC I is recycled to the profit and loss upon de recogn ition of the assets . 3 . Financial assets ( equ ity instruments ) measured at F VT OC I , with no re class ification of gains or losses to profit or loss on de recogn ition . On initial recognition the Bank can make the irre voc able election , on an instrument - by - in strument basis , to designate investments in an equity instrument which are not held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquire r in a business combination , as a financial asset measured at F VT OC I . Those not elected , which are primarily listed , are measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ( F VT PL ). D ivid ends received are recorded in the income statement . After initial recognition at cost , these financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value with all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value ( real ized and unreal ized ), including foreign exchange gains and losses , recognized in other comprehensive income , and are not re classified to income statement . For those financial instruments there is no impairment assessment . The fair value for those not purchased from an active market is determined using accepted valuation techniques which use unob serv able inputs . These valuation techniques used are net asset value , when this is deemed to approximate fair value , and earnings - based val uations using comparable information and discount ing cash flows . The Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments are included in this category . All such financial assets are recognized on settlement date . 4 . Financial assets measured at F VT PL : this category includes financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be classified in any of the above categories as \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 5 . 2 Measure ment The Bank measures financial assets at fair value on initial recognition , as detailed above . In the event the Bank considers that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price , that difference is recognized as a gain or loss on initial recognition but only if the fair value is based on a requested active market price for identical assets or is based on a valuation technique using data solely from identified markets . In all other cases , the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognized in the income statement when the inputs become observable , or when the instrument is de recogn ized . Financial assets that are subsequently measured at either AC or debt instruments at F VT OC I , are subject to provisions for impairment . Based on the Bank 's credit policy , the Bank does not originate credit - im pa ired financial assets , nor does the Bank purchase credit - im pa ired assets , exception being those loans would be acquired at a deep discount . Financial assets are not re classified subsequent to their initial recognition , except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets . 3 . 5 . 3 Business model assessment The factor of the business model refers , amongst others , to the manner in which the Bank manages its financial assets by class ifying them in portfolios that are part of its business model . The adopted business model determines the source of revenue , as it arises from individual portfolios either through the collection of contractual cash flows or from the sale of financial assets or the combination of the above . The assessment of the business model reflects the Bank 's strategy under normal business conditions . The assessment is not affected by actions required in âĢ ĺ emer gency situations âĢ Ļ ( e . g .: liquidity needs , non - in herent capital requirements for credit risk , etc .). Also , Management decisions taken to comply with new regulatory guidelines are not included in the assessment . In general , the Bank has included the majority of its loan portfolios in the hold - to - collect business model . The assessment of a business model is made within the definition of operational objectives as defined by the Bank 's Management , as well as in the operational management of its assets . The assessment is effected at portfolio level rather than at individual asset levels . The Business Model applied to loan portfolio , treasury portfolio and equity investment portfolio is reass essed at each reporting period . The reass essment of the Business Model has been established in order to determine if evidence initially used has changed . The assessment process applied by the Bank through its business model , based on strategic objectives , \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 6 3 . 5 . 4 Loans Loans originated by the Bank , is where money is provided directly to the borrower . Loans are initially recorded at fair value , which is usually the net amount dis b ursed at inception including directly attributable orig ination costs and certain types of fees or commission ( e . g . synd ication commission , front - end , commitment fees and handling charges ) that are regarded as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the loan , and are subsequently measured at am ort ized cost using the effective interest rate method . The Bank class ifies in loan category bonds which are purchased with a view of a development impact and such purchases are performed based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan financing criteria and follow the thorough appraisal and approval process of the Bank . Such bonds at 31 December 2021 were a gross amount of EUR 294 , 330 thousand ( 2020 : EUR 267 , 588 thousand ). Management has concluded that presentation within loans present fairly the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial position . Loans that are designated as at F VT PL are recognized at a value arrived at by using a combination of discounted cash flow models . These models incorporate market data pertaining to interest rates , a borrower 's credit rating , and underlying assets . Where unob serv able inputs have been used , a sensitivity analysis has been included under âĢ ĺ fair value hierarchy âĢ Ļ described within the âĢ ĺ R isk Management âĢ Ļ section of this report . Imp air ment 3 . 6 . 1 Financial assets The Bank records an allowance for expected credit loss for all loans and loans rece iv ables , and other debt instruments held at am ort ized cost , together with off balance sheet items ( lo an commitments and financial guarantee contracts ). In this section , all referred to as âĢ ĺ financial instruments âĢ Ļ . Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IF RS 9 . i ) Cal culation of expected credit loss E CL s are a probability - weight ed average estimate of credit losses that reflects the time value of money . Upon initial recognition of the financial instruments in scope of the impairment policy , the Bank records a loss allowance equal to 12 - month E CL , being the E CL that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months . Sub sequently , for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk ( S IC R ) since initial recognition , a loss allowance equal to lifetime E CL is recognized , arising from default events that are possible over the expected life of the instrument . The expected credit losses are weighted on the basis of three macro economic scenarios ( ad verse , basic \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank calculates impairment losses on a portfolio basis , except for financial assets that are credit - im pa ired in which case they are calculated on an individual basis . The Bank applies three main components to measure expected credit losses which are a LG D , PD and E AD , and assigns general market scenarios for potential credit risk deterioration . There can be transfers of exposures from one stage to another , depending on whether there is a change in the credit risk of that exposure . Prob ability of default is an estimate of the like lin ood of default over a given time horizon . The Bank uses information obtained from the Global Emerging Markets ( G EM s ) database in order to assign LG D to its loan asset classes . G EM s is an International Financial Institution ( IF I ) wide initiative designed to pool default and recovery rates experienced by IF ls in emerging markets . Treasury asset classes derive their PD s from the assigning rating agency . LG D is an estimate of the loss arising on default . The Bank uses information obtained from the G EM s database to assign LG Ds to its lending asset classes , and treasury asset classes derive their LG Ds from the assigning rating agency . ii ) Basic parameters used for the calculation of expected credit loss The calculation of expected credit losses is based on the following parameters : e Prob ability of Default ( PD ) represents the probability that a debtor will default on his debt obligations either over the next twelve months or over the remaining maturity of his debt . In accordance with IF RS 9 , the Bank uses non - disc rim inatory point - in - time PD s that adjust to macro economic assumptions using the Ex pected Credit Loss . Â° Exposure at Default ( E AD ) is defined as the estimate of the exposure at a future default date , taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date , including repay ments of principal and interest , and und rawn commitments based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s own experience . e Loss Given Default ( LG D ) represents the extent of the loss that the Bank expects for exposures that are in default and is defined as the difference between the contractual cash flows and those that the Bank expects to collect , including collateral amounts . LG D , which is usually expressed as a percentage of the E AD , varies according to the category of the counter party , the category and priority of the claim , the existence of collateral and other credit enhancements . The Bank assigns credit rating to each loan at inception based on the internal score card method ologies for Financial Instit utions , Corpor ates or Project Finance and all loans are subject to \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements iii ) Significant increase in credit risk At each reporting date , the Bank assess es whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition . When making the assessment , the Bank compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and support able information , that is available without undue cost or effort , that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition . In order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since orig ination , and hence transition to Stage 2 , a combination of quantitative and qualitative risk metrics are used . All loans with at least a 3 - not ch downgrade in PD on the Bank âĢ Ļ s internal ratings scale since orig ination , all loans for which the contractual payments are overdue by between 31 and 90 days inclusive , as well as all loans placed on the âĢ ĺ watch list âĢ Ļ are transitioned to Stage 2 . For financial guarantee contracts , the date the Bank becomes a party to the irre voc able commitment is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purpose of assessing the financial instrument for impairment . In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contract , the Bank considers the risk that the specified debtor will default on the contract in line with the above determination for loans . Generally , there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit - impaired or an actual default occurs . The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is key in transferring an exposure from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and the respective change in the E CL measurement from 12 - month to lifetime E CL . iv ) Credit - im pa ired A financial asset is credit - im pa ired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred . Evidence that a financial asset is credit - impaired includes observable data about the following events : - Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower ; - A breach of contract , such as a default or past due event ; - The lender ( s ) of the borrower , for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower 's financial difficulty , having granted to the borrower a concession ( s ) that the lender ( s ) would not otherwise consider ; - It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorgan ization ; - The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements a . Qual itative Unlike liness to Pay ( UT P ) criterion : the Bank considers that the oblig or is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security . Below there are some elements that are taken as indications of unlike liness to pay ( in line with CR R ( Article 178 )). - The Bank puts the credit obligation on non - acc rued status . - The Bank recognizes a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure . - The Bank has filed for the oblig or 's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an oblig or 's credit obligation to the Bank , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries . - The oblig or has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the Bank , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries . b . Quant itative Past due criterion : the exposure is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to the Bank . Imp air ment losses for guarantees are recognized while a guarantee is in effect and the amounts are determined based on the level of utilization of the guarantee . The methodology is consistent to that of loan commitments , and such losses are included in âĢ ĺ Other liabilities âĢ Ļ . Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 1 and 2 . As the primary definition for credit - im pa ired financial assets moving to Stage 3 , the Bank applies the definition of default , and interest income is calculated on the net carrying amount for these financial assets only . If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after a write - down , the release ( i . e . reverse ) of the impairment is credited to the provision for impairment asset losses . Un w inding of the discount is treated as income and remaining provision is then reass essed . 3 . 6 . 2 Non - financial assets At each financial position date , the Bank reviews the carrying value of the non - financial assets and assess es whether there is any indication of impairment . If such indications exist , an analysis is performed to assess whether the book value of the specific assets can be recovered . The recover able amount is the higher amount between the fair value less costs of disposal and of the value in use ( as calculated from the net cash flows ). If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its recover able value , then an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement . 3 . 6 . 3 Reneg oti ated financial assets \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 7 Mod ifications occur when the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegoti ated or otherwise modified . Some modifications result in de recogn ition of the existing asset and recognition of a new asset with the difference recognized as a de recogn ition gain or loss , to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded , while other modifications do not result in de recogn ition . Mod ifications that result in de recogn ition are considered to be substantial modifications . A significant or substantial change is defined when the customer enters into a new loan contract ( i . e . completely new product and new pricing ) that has a different interest rate type , loan amount , term period ( tem porary term extension is excluded ), and / or customer ( e . g . from single customer to joint or change in one of the joint customer names ). A distressed restructuring is an indication of unlike liness to pay where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material ( change in the net present value of the asset by more than 10 %) forgiveness , or postp onement of either principal , interest or , where relevant fees . Dist ressed restructuring occurs when forb earance measures have been extended towards a debtor . Therefore , those for borne exposures where the forb earance measures are likely to result in a diminished financial obligation are classified as default ed . Rest ruct ured operations will be considered cured and normalized after two successful repay ments ( average of 6 months per repayment ) and could therefore be subject to a Stage movement . For loans that are modified the Bank recal cul ates the gross book value based on the revised cash flows on the financial asset and recognizes the profit or loss from the modification in income statement . The new gross book value is recal culated by discount ing the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate . 3 . 6 . 4 Write - offs According to the IF RS 9 ( B 5 . 4 . 9 ), the gross carrying amount of a financial asset may be directly reduced when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset in its entirety or a portion of it . As such , the Bank may record a write - off of Stage 3 loans . The Bank may also , on an ad - h oc basis , examine the need for any further write - offs of Stage 2 loans if there is relevant evidence . 3 . 6 . 5 Write - backs Recover ies ( write - backs ) of an asset , or part thereof , are credited to the income statement if previously written off . Financial Li abilities The Bank recognizes a financial liability in its financial statements at the \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 7 . 1 . B orrow ings B orrow ing transactions which are amounts due to financial institutions and debts evidence by certificates , are recognized in the statement of financial position at the time the funds are transferred to the Bank . They are measured initially at the fair value of the funds transferred , less any transaction costs . They are subsequently measured at am ort ized cost unless they qualify for hedge accounting in which case the am ort ized cost is adjusted for the fair value movements attributable to the to the risks being hed ged . Interest expense is accrued in the income statement within âĢ ľ Interest expense âĢ Ŀ using the effective interest rate method . 3 . 7 . 2 Other liabilities Other liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at F VT PL , are recorded at am ort ized cost . The amounts include accrued finance charges on borrow ings and other accounts payable . 3 . 8 Off setting of Financial Assets and Li abilities Off setting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements is permitted if , and only if , there is a currently enforce able legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis , or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously . 3 . 9 Der iv atives In the ordinary course of business , the Bank enters into various types of transactions that involve derivative financial instruments . A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract between two parties , where future payments are dependent upon movements in price in one or more underlying financial instruments , reference rates or indices . The Bank primarily makes use of derivatives for the below strategic purposes : - Many of the Bank âĢ Ļ s issued securities , excluding commercial paper , are individually paired with a swap to convert the issuance proceeds into the currency and interest rate structure sought by the Bank . - To manage the net interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks arising from all financial assets and liabilities . - Through currency swaps , to manage funding requirements for the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio . Der iv atives can include interest rate and cross currency swaps , forward foreign exchange contracts , interest rate future contracts , and options on interest rates and foreign currencies . Such financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position ( SO FP ) at fair value and are subsequently measured at their fair value . They are carried in the SO FP as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative . Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in the income statement . Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices to the extent publicly available , discounted cash flows and options pricing models as appropriate \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements All the Bank âĢ Ļ s interest rate or cross currency swaps are explicitly tied to a balance sheet asset or liability . Typically , the fixed rate on the swap and the matching asset or liability have the same characteristics ( term , payment dates etc .). Foreign exchange forwards ( pa ired purchases and sales of currencies on different dates ) of m atur ities typically less than three months are not tied to specific assets or liabilities . These are undertaken to manage sur pl uses and short falls in EUR and USD and are not undertaken for speculative purposes . All derivatives are documented under International Sw aps and Der iv atives Association ( IS DA ) master net ting agreement with Credit Swap Annex es ( CS As ) and marked to market and cash collateral ized daily . The Department of Treasury , under the guidance of A LC O and the supervision of the AL M unit , is responsible for the primary usage and managing interest rate and currency risks in the Bank âĢ Ļ s statement of financial position . The not ional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 14 . The fair value hierarchy level of derivatives is disclosed in Note 5 . 3 . 9 . 1 Der iv atives and hedge accounting The Bank design ates certain derivatives as hed ging instruments in respect of foreign currency rate and interest rate risk in fair value or cash flow hed ges . The bank does not apply fair value hedge accounting of portfolio of hed ges of interest rate risk . In addition , the bank does not use the exception to continue using I AS 39 hedge accounting rules , that is the Bank applies IF RS 9 in full . In accordance with its wider risk management , as set out in Note 5 , when a hed ging relationship meets the specified hedge accounting criteria , it is the Bank âĢ Ļ s strategy to apply either fair value or cash flow hed ges based on the exposure being hed ged . Transactions that are entered into in accordance with the Bank âĢ Ļ s hed ging objectives , but do not qualify for hedge accounting , are referred to in these financial statements as economic hedge relationships . At the inception of the hedge relationship , the Bank formally documents how the hed ging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria , by recording the economic relationship between the hed ged item and the hed ging instrument , the nature of the risk , the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge as well as the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hed ging relationship . Furthermore , both at the inception and on an ongoing basis ( at least on each reporting date or upon significant change , whichever comes first ), the Bank documents whether an \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements For the assessment of hedge effectiveness requirements and when measuring the hedge effectiveness / in effect iveness , the Bank uses qualitative and supplementary quantitative analysis where applicable . Sources of hedge in effect iveness between the hed ged items and hed ging instruments , can arise from : Differences in timing of cash flows . Different applied discount interest rate curves . Non - nil fair value of derivatives at the designation date . The effect of changes in counterpart ies âĢ Ļ credit risk on the fair values . The Bank discontin ues hedge accounting prospect ively only when the hed ging relationship ( or a part thereof ) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria ( after reb al ancing , if applicable ) or the hed ging instrument expires or is sold , terminated or exercised . The not ional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments designated are disclosed separately in Note 14 . Hedge accounting disclosures are provided in Note 5 . 3 . 9 . 1 . 1 Fair value hed ges App lying fair value hedge accounting enables the Bank to reduce fair value fluctuations of the recognized fixed rate financial liabilities as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates , thus hed ging the exposure that is attributable to interest rate risk / foreign currency risk and could affect reported earnings . The Bank only hed ges changes due to interest rates , such as benchmark rates , which are typically the most significant component of the overall fair value change . The Bank assess es hedge effectiveness by comparing fair value movements of the hed ging instruments and the hed ged items attributable to changes in these benchmark rates . For designated and qualifying fair value hed ges , the change in the fair value of the qualifying hed ging instruments is recognized in profit or loss whereas the carrying value of a hed ged item that is not already measured at fair value , is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hed ged risk in the statement of financial position ( âĢ ľ B orrow ings âĢ Ŀ ), with a corresponding entry in profit or loss . The Bank recognizes the hed ging gains or losses from the hed ging instrument in profit or loss , in the same line as the adjustment for the hed ged item ( âĢ ľ net fair value gains ( loss es ) on derivative instruments âĢ Ŀ ). Accordingly , any ineffective part is recognized immediately in profit or loss . Upon discontin uation of hedge accounting , the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hed ged item arising from the hed ged risk , is am ort ized to profit or loss from that date , based on how the hed ged item impacts profit or loss . If the hed ged item is de recogn ized , the un am ort ized fair \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is limited to the cumulative fair value hedge of the hed ged item from the inception of the Hedge less any amounts recycled to profit or loss . For assessing the hedge effectiveness , the hypothetical derivative approach is applied , which involves establishing a not ional derivative that would be the ideal hed ging instrument for the hed ged exposure ( i . e . swap with a zero fair value at inception of the hedge relationship with the same critical terms as the hed ged items ) and then use as a proxy for measuring hedge effectiveness , the comparison between the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the fair value of the actual hed ging instrument . Provided that the hed ged cash flows are no longer expected to occur , then the Bank immediately re class ifies the amount in the cash flow hedge reserve from OC I to profit or loss , however on hedge discontin uations , if the hed ged cash flows are still expected to occur , then the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is not re classified until the hed ged cash flows affect profit or loss . 3 . 10 Financial Guarant ees Iss ued financial guarantees are initially recognized at their fair value , being the premium ( fee ) received and subsequently measured at the higher of the un am ort ized balance of the related fees received and deferred , and the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the financial position date . The latter is recognized when it is both probable that the guarantee will require to be settled and that the settlement amount can be reliably estimated . Financial guarantees are recognized within other financial assets and other financial liabilities . 3 . 11 Property and Equipment Property and equipment include lease hold improvements and transportation and other equipment . Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost , which includes all costs that are required to bring an asset into operating condition . Sub sequently to initial recognition , property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses . Costs incurred subsequently to the acquisition of an asset , which is classified as property and equipment are capital ized , only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Bank beyond those originally anticipated for the asset , otherwise they are exp ensed as incurred . At each reporting date the Bank assess es whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired . If any such indication exists , the Bank estimates the recover able amount of the asset . Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recover able am ourt , it is written down immediately to its recover able amount . G ains and losses on \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 12 Int angible Assets Int angible assets comprise software expenditures and other intangible assets . These assets are am ort ized on a straight - line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives , which is software for desk tops of three years and software for servers of five years . At each reporting date , management reviews intangible assets and assess es whether there is any indication of impairment . If such indications exist an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is fully recover able . A write - down is made if the carrying amount exceeds the recover able amount . 3 . 13 Right of Use Assets Right - of - use assets comprise those assets that the Bank , as the les see , has control of the underlying assets during the term of the lease . Control is considered to exist if the Bank has : - The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset ; and - The right to direct the use of that asset . The Bank provides for the recognition of a right - of - use asset and a lease liability upon lease commencement in case that there is a contract , or part of a contract , that conve ys to the Bank the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration . More details are provided within the lease accounting policy Note 3 . 21 . 3 . 14 Tax ation In accordance with Article 52 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Bank , its assets , property , income and its operations and transactions are exempt from all taxation and all customs duties in all Member Countries . The Bank is also exempt from any obligation for payment , withholding or collection of any tax or duty . Also , no tax shall be levied on salaries or em ol uments paid by the Bank to employees . These tax exemptions are also included and elaborated upon in Article 12 of the Headquarters Agreement with the Hell enic Government , ratified by Greek Law 23 80 / No . 38 / 7 . 3 . 1996 . 3 . 15 Prov isions The Bank records provisions for present obligations and risks when the following circumstances exist ( a ) there is an existing legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events ( b ) for the obligation to be settled an out flow of resources embod ying economic benefits is present and ( c ) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made . 3 . 16 Share Capital and D ivid ends In accordance with Article 36 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Board of Governors shall determine annually what part of net income or surplus of the Bank from operations shall be allocated to \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 18 Income and Exp ense Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method . The effective interest rate ( E IR ) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument ( or , where appropriate , a shorter period ) to : - The gross carrying amount of the financial asset ; or - The am ort ized cost of the financial liability . When calculating the E IR for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit - im pa ired assets the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument , but not the E CL . For purchased or originated credit - im pa ired financial assets , a credit - adjusted E IR is calculated using estimated future cash flows including the E CL . The calculation of the E IR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate . Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability . i ) Am ort ized cost ( AC ) and gross carrying amount The AC of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repay ments , plus or minus the cumulative am ort ization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and , for financial assets , adjusted for any E CL allowance . The gross carrying amount of a financial asset âĢ Ļ is the AC of a financial asset before adjusting for any E CL allowance . ii ) Cal culation of interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement for all interest bearing instruments using the effective interest rate method . Interest income includes interest on loans and advances to customers , coupons earned on fixed income investment securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other instruments . Fees and direct costs relating to a loan orig ination or acquiring an investment security , financing or restructuring and to loan commitments are deferred and am ort ized to interest income over the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method . Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss , interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss . The E IR of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability . In calculating interest income and expense , the E IR is applied to the gross carrying amount of the \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 19 iii ) Fees and commissions Fee and commission income and expense that are integral to the E IR on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the E IR . Other fee and commission income âĢĶ including account servicing fees , investment management fees , sales commission , placement fees and synd ication fees âĢĶ is recognized as the related services are performed . If a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw - down of a loan , then the related loan commitment fee is recognized on a straight - line basis over the commitment period . A contract with a customer that results in a recognized financial instrument in the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements may be partially in the scope of IF RS 9 and partially in the scope of IF RS 15 . If this is the case , then the Bank first applies IF RS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of IF RS 9 and then applies IF RS 15 to the residual . Fee and commission income from contracts with customers under the scope of IF RS 15 is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer . The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a service to a customer . The adoption of IF RS 15 had no impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements as the execution and completion of the transaction requested by a customer is done at point in time , and this is consistent with the Bank âĢ Ļ s existing accounting policy . Other fee and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees , which are exp ensed as the services are received . iv ) Interest rate benchmark reform At present the Bank is continuing the usage of Lib or as the interest rate benchmark of which the Bank is exposed to , as there is uncertainty to the timing and precise form of the new benchmark that has yet to be finalized . The adoption will not have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . Staff Retirement and Termin ation Benefits The Bank has established a pension plan , where the fund âĢ Ļ s assets are held separately from the Bank âĢ Ļ s own assets , for all its eligible employees , consisting of three pillars : a . The first pillar is a defined post - employment benefit scheme financed entirely by the Bank . The scheme âĢ Ļ s funding level and the Bank âĢ Ļ s contributions are determined on the basis of actu arial val uations performed by qualified , independent actu aries on an annual basis at the end of each annual reporting period . The actu arial valuation uses the projected unit credit method and a number of financial and demographic assumptions . The most significant assumptions include age \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements C . The third pillar is a defined contribution scheme funded entirely by each employee , up to 40 % of basic salary and is not recorded in the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . As an alternative , staff are entitled to retirement benefits from the Greek State Social Insurance Fund ( EF KA ), which is a defined contribution scheme . Current service costs in respect of both the pension plan ( a ) and ( b ) and EF KA are recognized as an expense in the period which they relate and are included in âĢ ĺ Person nel expenses âĢ Ļ . The Bank may offer termination benefits to employees that are separated based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s separation policy . These benefits , including indemn ities and any related retirement benefits , are recognized in income as an expense in the same period they are incurred . 3 . 20 Related Parties Related parties include entities , which the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence in making financial and operational decisions . Related par ities include key management personnel , and close family members of key management personnel . 3 . 21 Le ases âĢĶ the Bank as a L essee On 1 January 2019 the Bank adopted IF RS 16 , âĢ ĺ Le ases âĢ Ļ . This Standard has established the principles for the recognition , measurement and presentation of leases , and provides a single les see accounting model that is required at the commencement date of the lease . The objective is to report information that ( a ) faithfully represents lease transactions and ( b ) provides a basis for the amount , timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases . The Bank as a les see is required to recognize right - of - use assets ( represent ing the Bank âĢ Ļ s right to use the underlying leased assets ) and a lease liability ( represent ing the Bank âĢ Ļ s obligation to make lease payments ), in the statement of financial position . The Bank applied the practical exped ient in IF RS 16 to contracts that were identified as leases in order to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease , on transition to contracts that were previously identified as leases under I AS 17 and I FR IC 4 . Consequently , the Bank âĢ Ļ s leases are only for office space ; and does not lease land , corporate vehicles , or technical or IT equipment , nor does the Bank have any sale - and - lease back transactions . The Bank elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach , without rest at ement of comparative figures . Under this approach , the Bank was able to choose on a lease by lease basis to measure the right - of - use asset at the same amount as the lease liability .

SIGN IFIC ANT ACC OUNT ING J UD G EMENT S AND KEY SOU RC ES OF EST IM ATION UNC ER TAIN TY The preparation of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements requires Management to make jud gements , estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , income and expense and accompanying notes . Unc ertain ty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods . The Bank believes that the significant judgments , estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its condensed interim financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of the date of preparation . The most significant areas , for which critical judgments , estimates and assumptions are required in applying the Bank âĢ Ļ s accounting policies , are the following : a . Fair value estimates for financial s instruments carried at fair value . b . The Bank âĢ Ļ s method for determining the level of impairment of loan operations is described within the Accounting and further explained in Note 5 Risk Management âĢĶ credit risk section . In accordance with IF RS 9 , E CL represents the average credit losses weighted by the probabilities of default ( PD ), whereby credit losses are defined as the present value of all cash short falls . The E CL is calculated for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans by applying the provision rate to the projected exposure at default ( E AD ), and discount ing the resulting provision using the loan âĢ Ļ s effective interest rate ( E IR ). The provision rate is generated by multiplying the PD rate and the loss given default ( LG D ) rate applicable to the loan . A number of critical accounting estimates are therefore made in the calculation of impairment of loan operations as follows : Â° Crit eria used for staging assessment of loans and advances to customers . e Ass um ptions for future cash flows of individually assessed credit - im pa ired exposures . Â° The input and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple economic scenarios . For loans that are individually assessed which have a lifetime E CL and that are credit - impaired in Stage 3 , the impairment allowance results from the impairment test that is conducted on the basis of objective evidence obtained through a risk asset review process . An impairment test includes projected cash in - flows and out - flows , available for debt service until maturity , which are discounted at the original effective interest rate ( E IR ) to reach a net present value for a particular operation , less any collateral that can be realized . 33 \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 4 . 1 Cov id - 19 The continuation of the Cov id - 19 pand emic means that the Bank could face additional credit , market and operational risks . The duration of the pand emic is difficult to predict at this time , as are the extent and effectiveness of economic interventions by the governments and central banks in the region of the Bank âĢ Ļ s operations . The Bank continues to monitor the developments and to manage the risks associated with the Bank âĢ Ļ s various portfolios within existing financial policies and constraints . The two main areas that affect the Bank âĢ Ļ s judgement and estimates are : 1 . The Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments which will likely see a reduced fair value due to the downward pressure , although the Bank has a small portfolio such investments , and therefore the Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability will not be materially impacted . 2 . The Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio due to business disruption that can occur in economic activity in the region will put pressure for borrowers , affecting those operating primarily in the service and consumer goods industries . This could likely force debt restructuring and an increase in defaults among less robust operations . The Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability could be impacted by a severe increase in E CL on performing loans , driven by worsening of the macro - economic outlook scenarios . With regard of the Bank âĢ Ļ s operational risk the information technology ( IT ) systems have proven they are stable , powerful and flexible , as the majority of the Bank âĢ Ļ s staff were working successfully remotely . The Bank is also investing in new IT infrastructure to expand digital and cloud transformation , as well as strengthening the Bank âĢ Ļ s cybersecurity and internal control systems . 34 \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 5 . RIS K MAN AG EMENT The Bank âĢ Ļ s activities are subject to a variety of risks , some of which are not within the Bank âĢ Ļ s control : including risks relating to changes in interest rates , foreign exchange rates , declines in liquidity and deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolio . The Bank monitors and manages the m atur ities of its loans , its interest rate and exchange rate exposure , its liquidity position and the credit quality of each individual loan and equity investment in order to minimize the effects of changes in them relative to the Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability and liquidity position . The Bo D has approved risk management policies and guidelines that are delegated to the Management of the Bank for the identification and measurement of risk , as well as being subject to risk limits and controls . To manage risks the Bank has established an Asset and Li ability Committee ( AL CO ), a Credit Committee ( CC ) that implement the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit and lending policies , the Legal Affairs Department , the Risk Management Department and the Financial Analysis Department , which together are responsible for dev ising , implementing and monitoring the Bank âĢ Ļ s risk management policies , including financial , credit and market risks . The A LC O is responsible for monitoring and managing the Bank âĢ Ļ s overall asset and liability position in accordance with the Bank âĢ Ļ s treasury policies . It monitors and manages the Bank âĢ Ļ s liquidity position , maturity gaps , interest income and expense and the condition of the international financial markets and is responsible for assigning market risk limits . The A LC O consists of members of the Bank âĢ Ļ s Management and a member of the Treasury Department and has regular monthly meetings . The Credit Committee is responsible with respect to credit matters . Its key responsibilities include : approval of lending operations for submission to the Bo D for final approval , establishing specific parameters ( e . g . policies , limits , targets , guidelines ) for operational decision - making , approval of changes to the manuals that prescribe how operations are to be analyzed , approved , administered and monitored and approval of any amendments , restructuring and other operation - related matters . The Credit Committee consists of members of the Bank âĢ Ļ s Management , and has regular meetings as required to monitor and manage overall risk concentration by reference to borrower and industry exposure and critically reviews each individual loan and equity investment proposal made by the lending business areas . A major function of the Credit Committee is to minimize the credit risk presented by each individual loan and equity investment proposal , and the overall portfolio risk of the Bank . Once an operation is approved and dis b \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements For the Bank a conservative approach to risk taking together with effective risk management , are critical to the Bank âĢ Ļ s continuing operations . The application of sound banking principles in the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit process seeks to ensure that the significant credit risks are properly identified and managed while other risks resulting from its activities are mit igated to the extent possible . Import antly , the Bank is recognized as an international financial institution , and as such can expect to benefit from the preferred creditor status custom arily and historically afforded to such institutions . This preferred creditor status serves to provide an additional layer of comfort against the risks of non - payment on sovereign debt or by private sector borrowers as a result of local laws creating a delay or freeze on foreign - currency exchanges . The Bank is exposed to the following risks discussed below . Financial Risk The Bank âĢ Ļ s exposure to financial risk is through its financial assets and financial liabilities including any rece iv ables from these financial assets . The key aspects of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial risk are ( i ) credit risk ( ii ) liquidity risk and ( iii ) market risk . a ) Credit risk The Bank is subject to credit risk , which is the risk that customers or counterpart ies will be unable to meet their obligations as they fall due . Credit risk arises principally from the Bank âĢ Ļ s lending activities as well as other activities where the Bank is exposed to counter party default risk . Regular reviews by the departments of Risk Management , Financial Analysis and Project Implementation and Monitoring are conducted of all exposures within the lending portfolios , typically on a semi - ann ual basis , though exposures that are perceived to be more vulnerable to possible default are reviewed more frequently . At each review there is ( i ) an assessment of whether there has been any change in the risk profile of the exposure ( ii ) recommendations of actions to mitigate risk and ( iii ) recon f irming or adjusting the risk ratings , and for equity investments , reviewing of fair value . Where relevant , the level of the expected credit loss is evaluated and recon f irmed or adjusted . Responsibility for operations considered to be in jeopardy may be transferred from the original lending department to a corporate recovery team in order to most effectively manage the restructuring and recovery process . For credit risks incurred by the Bank âĢ Ļ s Treasury in its investment and hed ging activities , the Bo D has approved policies and guidelines for the determination of counter party and investment exposure limits in bonds , that includes member state bonds , and euro commercial paper . The Bank âĢ Ļ s Risk Management Department assigns and monitors these counter party and issuer credit risk \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements al .

This limit is calculated on the basis of the Bo D approved operations , minus repay ments and cancell ations . Individual operations are further constrained by the Single Ob lig or Limit and by monitoring of Sect oral Exposure . a 6 . Coll ateral and credit enhancements The Bank mit ig ates credit risk by holding collateral and other credit enhancements against exposure to customers and counterpart ies where it believes such security is necessary . The Bank defines security as mechanisms , procedures and assets negotiated in transactions that are meant to protect it against loss in case of non - performance . Security includes , but is not limited to , material assets , financial instruments , guarantees , co venants and comfort letters . e Loans and advances . The Bo D approved guidelines for taking security under lending operations , set the levels and types of collateral and other credit enhancements recommended for a given risk profile . The main types of collateral that may be obtained by the Bank are : mortgages on properties and equipment , pledges of equity shares and investment instruments , assignment of rights on certain contracts , cash or blocked deposits and other third party guarantees . If necessary , the Bank reass esses the value of collateral in order to determine if additional collateral is needed to be provided by the borrower . At 31 December 2021 the secured portfolio was 55 . 8 % ( 2020 : 53 . 9 %) of the outstanding loans balance . e Other financial instruments . Coll ateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the instrument . Bonds and euro commercial paper held by the Bank as investment securities are generally un sec ured . The Bank may hold cash or government securities as collateral against its derivative contract counterpart ies . At 31 December 2021 the Bank had pledged as collateral for derivative transactions a net amount of EUR 14 , 150 thousand ( 2020 : EUR 3 , 320 thousand ). e For loans that are credit - im pa ired at the reporting date the Bank has collateral held as security , an amount of EUR 38 , 864 thousand to mitigate credit risk . The types of collateral with approximate values are real estate EUR 21 , 782 thousand , machinery and equipment EUR 6 , 175 thousand , and pledged shares EUR 10 , 9 07 thousand . b ) Liquid ity risk Liquid ity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financing and investment activities and in the management of positions . It concerns the ability of the Bank to fulfill its financial obligations as they become due and is a measure of the extent to \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank âĢ Ļ s commitment to maintaining a strong liquidity position is established in policies approved by the Bo D . The liquidity policy requires that the Bank maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of 50 % of the following 12 months âĢ Ļ net cash requirement , including committed undis b ursed project and trade finance loans . The Bank âĢ Ļ s liquidity position is monitored regularly , and the A LC O is primarily responsible for the management of liquidity risk and the liquidity profile of the Bank . The Bank âĢ Ļ s liquid assets are maintained in short - term and neg ot iable securities that primarily are : ( i ) cash and bank balances ( ii ) short term deposits with investment grade rated counterpart ies ( iii ) Euro - den ominated commercial paper issued by investment grade parties and ( iv ) investment grade bonds . The table below presents the maturity profile of the und isc ount ed cash flows for financial liabilities placed based on the remaining period from the financial position date to the contractual maturity date . It indicates the earliest maturity dates that the Bank âĢ Ļ s counterpart ies have the ability to demand repayment . The figures represent und isc ount ed cash flows ( except for derivatives liabilities ), and include estimated interest amounts , and therefore do not match to the statement of financial position .

As a matter of policy , the Bank aims to keep foreign exchange exposure as close to zero as possible , with exceptions to this practice requiring approval from the A LC O . For local currency transactions the Bank matches the operation âĢ Ļ s currency with borrow ings in the same currency , as such there is no material exposure . The tables below provide a currency breakdown of the Bank âĢ Ļ s assets and liabilities , showing that the effect of any currency fluctuations on the net exposure is minimal .

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluct uate , favorably or unf avor ably , due to changes in market interest rates . The length of time for which the rate of interest is determined on a financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to that interest rate risk . The Bank âĢ Ļ s interest rate risk management activities aim to enhance profitability , by limiting the effect on asset values of adverse interest rate movements in order to increase net interest income by managing interest rate exposure . The majority of the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio is variable interest rate and the Bank has a policy aimed at minimizing interest rate mism atches between its assets and liabilities that seeks to ensure that the interest rate payment periods for its liabilities are matched as closely as possible to interest rate payment periods for the Bank âĢ Ļ s assets .

Sens itivity analysis Currency risk sensitivity The Bank is marginally sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations of the US dollar and the Euro . The Bank âĢ Ļ s paid - in capital is held in Euro and the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio is typically den ominated as 60 % Euro , 30 % US dollar and 10 % other local currencies . In addition , the Bank âĢ Ļ s administrative expenses are den ominated in Euro , and the Bank âĢ Ļ s income is typically den ominated as 60 % Euro , 30 % US dollar and 10 % other local currency . The Bank has addressed this sensitivity to currency risk by increasing its percentage of loans den ominated in Euro , and therefore increasing its Euro den ominated income . Interest rate sensitivity The Bank âĢ Ļ \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements c 4 . Hed ges of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk Fair value hed ges The Bank uses pay floating / re ceive fixed interest rate and cross - currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks , der iving from its issuance of both Euro and den ominated in foreign currencies debt ( main ly USD , AUD and R ON ). The Bank hed ges interest rate risk to the extent of the benchmark interest rate exposure of the floating leg ( main ly Eur ib or , USD Lib or ). Provided that the aforementioned exposures satisfy the hedge accounting criteria ( please see Note 3 . 9 . 1 ), these are designated in fair value hed ges . Upon designation , the fair value change on the qualifying hed ging instruments is recognized in profit or loss . Also , the change in fair value of the hed ged item attributable to the hed ged risk is recognized in the same line item in profit or loss . If the carrying amount of the hed ged item is not already measured at fair value ( me asured at cost or am ort ized cost ), then it is adjusted accordingly , with a corresponding entry . The Bank recognizes any ineffective portion of the fair value hedge relationships in profit and loss under the âĢ ľ Un real ized net fair value gains ( loss es ) on derivative instruments âĢ Ŀ line item . Upon hedge discontin uation , any hed ging adjustment made to a hed ged item for which the effective interest method is used , is am ort ized to profit or loss , by adjusting the effective interest rate from the date on which am ort ization begins . If the hed ged item is de recogn ized , then the adjustment is recognized immediately in profit or loss . The Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1 : 1 , by align ing the par amount of the fixed - rate liability and the not ional amount of the interest rate and cross currency swap designated as a hed ging instrument . Note 3 . 9 . 1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the fair value hed ges . At 31 December 2021 , the Bank held the following interest rate and cross currency swaps as hed ging instruments in fair value hed ges of interest and foreign currency risk ( 2020 : nil ): Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) At 31 December 2021 1 - 5 years Over 5 years Interest Rate Sw aps Hedge of borrow ings / euro notes : Nom inal amount 120 , 000 Average fixed interest rate 1 . 44 % Cross Currency Sw aps Hedge of borrow ings / other notes : Nom inal amount 15 , 8 47 19 , 330 Average EUR : AUD exchange rate 1 . 56 Average EUR : PL \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The amounts relating to items designated as hed ging instruments and hedge in effect iveness at 31 December 2021 were as follows ( 2020 : nil ): Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) At 31 December 2021 Line item in the statement of Change in fair value used for Line item in In effect iveness profit or loss Nom inal Car rying amount where the n ede ing and ge recognized in that includes : : . : profit or loss hedge instrument is in effect iveness in effect iveness included for 2021 Assets Li abilities Der iv ative Net fair value financial gains ( loss es ) Interest rate swaps âĢĶ instruments âĢĶ on derivative hedge of borrow ings 120 , 000 : 6 , 118 liabilities ( 6 , 118 ) ( 471 ) _ instruments Der iv ative Net fair value financial gains ( loss es ) Cross currency swaps âĢĶ instruments âĢĶ on derivative hedge of borrow ings 35 , 178 - 3 , 177 liabilities ( 3 , 177 ) 1 , 389 instruments Total 155 , 178 - 9 , 294 ( 9 , 294 ) 9 18 The amounts relating to items designated as hed ged items at 31 December 2021 were as follows ( 2020 : nil ): Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) At 31 December 2021 Car rying amount Line item in the statement of financial position in which the Change in value used for calculating hedge hed ged item is included in effect iveness Assets Li abilities Euro Notes issued - 114 , 353 B orrow ings 5 , 647 Other Notes Iss ued - 30 , 612 B orrow ings 4 , 5 66 Total - 144 , 9 65 10 , 213 During the year ended 31 December 2021 , there were no amounts related to settled swaps . Cash flow hed ges As part of the risk management strategy objective , the Bank also uses pay fixed / re ceive fixed cross - currency interest rate swaps , in order to hedge the exposure to the variability in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk in respect to its issuance of fixed rate notes den ominated in foreign currencies ( e . g . CH F ). When such hed ging relationships meet the specified hedge accounting criteria , these are designated in cash flow hed ges . Upon designation , the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hed ges is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income ( OC I ) and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedge reserve , limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hed ged item from the inception of the hedge . Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit and loss and is included in the âĢ ľ Un real ized net fair \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1 : 1 , by align ing the par amount of the fixed - rate liability and the not ional amount of the interest rate and cross currency swap designated as a hed ging instrument . Note 3 . 9 . 1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the cash flow hed ges . At 31 December 2021 , the Bank designated a pay fixed - re ceive fixed cross - currency interest rate swap ( USD : CH F ) in cash flow hedge relationship . The hed ging instrument âĢ Ļ s nominal amount was EUR 143 , 177 thousand , with the corresponding hed ged item being Swiss franc notes issued , as included in the Bank âĢ Ļ s statement of financial position ( under âĢ ľ B orrow ings âĢ Ŀ line item ). For this outstanding hed ged designation , the balance in the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to EUR 49 3 thousand loss ( 2020 : nil ) ( see Note 24 ). During the year ended 31 December 2021 , there were no amounts related to settled swaps . C 5 . Equity price risk The Bank has a small equity investments portfolio and as such does not have significant market risk exposure concerning foreign exchange or equity price risk on this portfolio . At 31 December 2021 the Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments are classified at F VT OC I , except for one , and are primarily un listed . The Bank takes a long - term approach of its equity investments and has no intention of exiting from any , therefore accepts the short - term vol at ilities in value from exchange rate and price risk . The Bank expects the effect on net income to be of little to no impact . Additional sensitivity information for the Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments has been included under âĢ ĺ Fair value hierarchy âĢ Ļ later in this section and in the Note âĢ ľ Equ ity investments âĢ Ļ . Oper ational Risk Like all financial institutions , the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes . Oper ational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people , systems , legal , and from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse rep ut ational impact . The Bank has a low tolerance for losses arising from the operational risks the Bank is exposed to . The Compliance and Oper ational Risk Management Department ( D CR ) has oversight on operational risk activities across the Bank . The Bank âĢ Ļ s operational risk framework is a network of processes , procedures , reports and responsibilities that are used to identify , manage and monitor the operational risks of the Bank . These include committees , working groups , day - to - day practices such \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank âĢ Ļ s risk and control assessments of the key operational risks in each business area are comprehensive and primarily bottom - up . They are based on Bank - wide operational risk definitions , that classify risks under a standard ize approach , cover the inherent risks of each business area and control function , provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of the controls in place to mitigate these risks , determine the residual risk ratings and require a decision to either accept or remed iate any remaining risk . Con cerning cyber crime , which is risk of loss or damage to the Bank âĢ Ļ s business areas and customers as a result of actions committed or facilitated through the use of network ed information systems , the Bank âĢ Ļ s Information Technologies Department ( DIT ), and information security policies and procedures ensure that all servers and computers have up to date antiv irus software . Back ups are made regularly and regular access control checks , system penetration and vulnerability tests along with disaster recovery tests are performed . The Bank âĢ Ļ s anti - cy ber attack controls are checked and aligned with industry best practice by the D IT . The Bank regularly produces management information reports covering the key inputs and outputs of operational risk . These reports are used to monitor outcomes against agreed targets and tolerance levels . The Bank utilizes the Bank âĢ Ļ s IT systems and other information tools to ensure operational risks are identified and managed properly . Overall , the Bank is committed to follow the best practices and market standards in the area of accountability , transparency and business ethics . Due diligence on customers and counterpart ies take into consideration the Anti - F raud Corruption and Monetary L aundering Policy and Know - Your Customer Procedures . The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plans , and a disaster recovery off - site which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank , namely , the member countries , bond holders and other creditors as well as employees and their families , in the event of any disturbance in office locations . Fair Value Hier archy For the above financial instruments measured at fair value , the Bank uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique : e Level 1 : Qu oted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ; e Level 2 : Other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable , either directly or indirectly ; and Â° Level 3 : Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data .

The Bank considers that market participants would use the same inputs in pricing the financial assets . Management considers that changing the unob serv able inputs described below to reflect other reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not result in a significant change in the estimated fair value .

Accordingly , the Bank âĢ Ļ s paid - in share capital was doubled from S DR 300 million to S DR 600 million . The remaining S DR 1 billion of authorized share capital has not yet been allocated . Purs u ant to Resolution 131 of the Bo G , that unanimously adopted the first amendment to the Est ablish ing Agreement , which became effective on 21 June 2013 . As of this effective date , and as per Resolution 131 of the Bo G , the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all of the Bank âĢ Ļ s authorized share capital was red en ominated from S DR to EUR . The conversion rate applied was S DR to EUR fixed at 1 : 1 . 15 . The share capital usage of the Bank is guided by statutory and financial policy parameters . Article 15 of the Est ablish ing Agreement limits the total amount of outstanding loans , equity investments and guarantees made for ordinary operations to 150 % of the Bank âĢ Ļ s unim pa ired subscribed capital , reserves and sur pl uses , establishing a 1 . 5 : 1 institutional gearing ratio . Additionally , dis b ursed equity investments shall not at any time exceed an amount corresponding to the Bank âĢ Ļ s total unim pa ired paid - in capital , sur pl uses and general reserve . The Bank determines required share capital as the potential losses the Bank may incur based on probabilities consistent with the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit rating . The main risk categories assessed under the share capital adequ acy framework are credit risk , market risk and operational risk , and such total risks are managed within the available share capital base that excludes call able share capital , while maintaining a prudent cushion . A main objective of this framework is to manage the Bank âĢ Ļ s share capital by providing a consistent measurement of capital head room over time . The Bank has no expectation for call able share capital to be called , and will prevent this need and use only available risk share capital as reserves , surplus and paid - in . At the 36 meeting of the Bo D in 2008 , the operational gearing ratio was set at 100 % of the Bank âĢ Ļ s unim pa ired paid - up capital , reserves and sur pl uses , and the usable portion of the call able capital . This limit on the total amount of operations which includes all call able capital is approximately EUR 2 . 6 billion . Overall , the Bank preserves an actively managed capital stock to prud ently cover risks \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 6 .

IM PA IR MENT L OSS ES ON LO ANS Loans that are measured at am ort ized cost are stated net of provisions for impairment , which includes also their related provisions for impairment on und rawn commitments . A summary of the movements in provisions for impairment is as follows : Stage Stage Stage Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) 1 2 3 Total At 31 December 2019 2 , 89 1 5 , 986 34 , 437 43 , 314 New loans originated 2 , 9 13 - - 2 , 9 13 Release ( 574 ) ( 3 , 275 ) ( 1 , 355 ) ( 5 , 204 ) Transfer ( 2 , 465 ) 8 2 , 457 - Change in model or risk parameters 13 , 07 2 401 1 , 712 15 , 185 Foreign exchange adjustments ( 338 ) ( 65 ) 132 ( 271 ) At 31 December 2020 15 , 499 3 , 055 37 , 383 55 , 9 37 New loans originated 1 , 519 - - 1 , 519 Release ( 4 , 652 ) ( 2 , 652 ) ( 1 , 299 ) ( 8 , 603 ) Transfer ( 248 ) 248 - - Change in model or risk parameters ( 7 , 400 ) - 2 , 602 ( 4 , 798 ) Foreign exchange adjustments 265 ( 32 ) ( 65 ) 168 At 31 December 2021 4 , 98 3 6 19 38 , 6 21 44 , 223 At each reporting date , the Bank recognizes loss allowances based on either 12 - month E CL or lifetime E CL , depending on the state of the loan . Total impairment losses on loans was EUR 44 , 223 thousand in 2021 , a decrease of EUR 11 , 714 thousand compared to 2020 . The decrease in Ex pected Credit Loss ( EC L ) is mainly attributed to the stabilization of the Cov id - 19 pand emic , driven by modest improvements of macro economic variables used for some member countries as their economies bounced back from the Cov id - 19 pand emic . The increase amount in Stage 3 is due to the deterioration of a few loans reducing their carrying amount . In 2019 the Bank purchased a portion of a loan in deep discount an amount of EUR 8 , 278 thousand which paid EUR 2 , 09 7 thousand and credited an impairment loss of EUR 6 , 181 thousand recognized in stage 3 rather than purchased credit impaired , as the loan agreement on the portion purchased specified that the contractual obligations would be identical as that of the Bank âĢ Ļ s . St aging Crit eria 12 - month E CL ( Stage 1 ) As IF RS 9 does not distinguish between individually significant or not individually significant financial instruments , the Bank measures potential credit losses for \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements Rev olving Facilities and Und rawn Commit ments Rev olving credit facilities have no fixed term and they can be cancelled at the discretion of the Bank at any point in time . These facilities are subject to , at a minimum , an annual credit review . In this regard , the date of the latest credit review is considered the relevant date to assess if there is any increase in credit risk , as at that point in time . Following this , the Bank may amend the terms and conditions of the exposure . The estimate of the E CL s on irre voc able loan commitments is consistent with its expectations of draw downs on that loan commitment . Therefore , the Bank considered ( i ) the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12 - month expected credit losses and ( ii ) the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over the expected life of the reporting date when estimating lifetime expected credit losses . At 31 December 2021 the amount of expected credit losses was EUR 193 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 208 , 203 thousand ( 2020 : EUR 9 83 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 245 , 143 thousand ). 13 .

LE ASE LIA BILITY The Bank has entered into a lease contract only for its Headquarters premises , which includes renewal options and periodic escalation clauses . There are no other commitments at end of year arising from non - cancell able lease contract . On adoption of IF RS 16 the impact in the statement of financial position of the recognition of right - of - use asset and corresponding lease liability , together with the movement for the year , is analyzed as follows : Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) Total Le ase liability due to initial application of IF RS 16 at 1 January 2019 1 , 9 31 Pre payment of rental ( 196 ) Interest expense on the lease liability - Le ase payments recognized in administrative expenses ( 676 ) Le ase liability at 31 December 2019 1 , 059 Le ase payments recognized in administrative expenses ( 676 ) Le ase liability at 31 December 2020 383 Renew al of lease term 349 Less payments recognized in administrative expenses ( 689 ) Le ase liability at 31 December 2021 43 IF RS 16 indicates that at the commencement date , the les see ( the Bank ) will discount the lease payment using ( a ) the interest rate implicit in the lease or ( b ) the les see âĢ Ļ s incremental borrowing rate if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined . The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a les see would have to pay to borrow the funds to obtain ( i ) an asset of a similar value to the underlying asset ( ii ) over a similar term ( iii ) with similar security ( iv ) in a similar economic environment . As the Bank has only one lease arrangement that is nearing maturity , Management concluded that any adjustment or any subsequent interest does not have a material impact on the financial statements . The Bank presents right - of - use assets separately as property and equipment , and the lease liability separately within pay ables and accrued interest , in the statement of financial position . Consequently , the Bank recognizes lease payments and interest , if any on the lease liability on a straight - line basis over the period of the lease term , similarly to any benefits received or that are rece ivable , in the income statement . When a lease is terminated before the lease period has expired , any payments \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements 23 . SH ARE CAP ITAL From the Bank âĢ Ļ s inception , and in accordance with Article 4 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Bank den ominated its authorized share capital in the Special Drawing Right ( S DR ) as defined by the International Monetary Fund ( IM F ). Resolution 131 of the Bo G unanimously adopted the requisite amendments to paragraph 1 of Article 4 and Articles 23 and 24 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , to expressly include among the exclusive powers of the Bo G the change of the unit of account of the Bank , and the red en omination of all capital stock of the Bank . These amendments to the Est ablish ing Agreement became effective on 21 June 2013 ( the âĢ ĺ Effective Date âĢ Ļ ). In accordance with such Resolution 131 of the Bo G as of the Effective Date the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and the authorized capital stock of the Bank was red en ominated into three billion four hundred and fifty million EUR ( 3 , 450 , 000 , 000 ), divided into three million ( 3 , 000 , 000 ) shares having a par value of one thousand and one hundred and fifty EUR ( 1 , 150 ) each , inclusive of all subscribed and un all ocated shares . Accordingly , as of the Effective Date , all outstanding share capital commitments of participating members in respect of their subscribed shares were converted into EUR . The authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased at such time and under such terms as may seem advisable . The Bank âĢ Ļ s capital stock is divided into paid - in shares ( fully paid and payable in installments ) and call able shares . Payment for the paid - in shares subscribed to by members was made over a period of years in accordance with Article 6 of the Est ablish ing Agreement for the initial capital raising purpose of the Bank , and as determined in advance by the Bank for capital increases ( in the only capital increase of the Bank so far , the structure of payments specified was similar to the one in Article 6 ). The same Article states that payment of the amount subscribed to in respect of the call able shares is subject to call only as and when required by the Bank to meet its obligations . Under Article 37 of the Est ablish ing Agreement any member may withdraw from the Bank by transmitting a notice in writing to the Bank at its Headquarters . With draw al by a member shall become effective and its membership shall cease on the date specified in its notice , but in no event less than six months after such notice is received by the Bank . However , at any time before the withdrawal becomes finally effective \n\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements Furthermore , Azerbaijan also subscribed to the 3 % of the initial authorized share capital that remained un all ocated , after the above mentioned participation reduction , while Romania subscribed both to their allocation of new shares and to those that would have been allocated to Georgia had it chosen to participate in the capital increase . This subscription process followed a decision taken by the Bo G in December 2007 to triple the Bank âĢ Ļ s authorized capital to EUR 3 . 45 billion and to double the subscribed capital to EUR 2 . 3 billion , while leaving authorized capital of EUR 1 . 15 billion un all ocated . On October 2011 the Bo G approved the request from Mold ova for a 50 % reduction of its portion of subscribed capital , from 1 % to 0 . 5 %, and those shares were released to un all ocated share capital . The above share capital is analyzed as follows : At At 31 December 31 December Pres ented in EUR ( 000 ) 2021 2020 Author ized share capital 3 , 450 , 000 3 , 450 , 000 Less : un all ocated share capital * ( 1 , 161 , 500 ) ( 1 , 161 , 500 ) Sub scribed share capital 2 , 288 , 500 2 , 288 , 500 Less : shares not yet called ( 1 , 601 , 950 ) ( 1 , 601 , 950 ) Paid - up share capital 6 86 , 550 6 86 , 550 Advance against future call - - Paid - in share capital 6 86 , 550 6 86 , 550 * Shares available to new or existing Member States . Initial Capital In accordance with paragraph 2 under Article 5 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the initially authorized capital stock was subscribed by and issued to each Member as follows : 10 % ( E UR 115 million ) fully paid and 20 % ( E UR 230 million ) payable by prom iss ory notes or other obligations which were not neg ot iable and non - interest bearing in eight equal successive annual installments in the years 1998 to 2005 . Capital Increase The capital increase of EUR 1 . 15 billion is divided into EUR 345 million paid in capital and EUR 8 05 million call able capital .

In our opinion , the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly , in all material respects , the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31 , 2024 and 20 23 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards ( âĢ ľ K orean IF RS âĢ Ŀ ). Bas is for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Aud iting ( âĢ ľ IS As âĢ Ŀ ) and Korean Standards on Aud iting ( âĢ ľ KS As âĢ Ŀ ). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Aud itors âĢ Ļ Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Consolid ated Financial Statements section of our report . We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Account ant âĢ Ļ s International : Code of Ethics for Professional Account ants ( including International Independence Standards ) ( âĢ ľ IES BA Code âĢ Ŀ ) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea , and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the I ES BA Code . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that , in our professional judgment , were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31 , 2024 . These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole , and in forming our opinion there on , and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters . 1 ) Evaluation \n\n\n Pavel 2 ) Sales deduction related to sales promotion activities The Group âĢ Ļ s Device e X per ience ( DX ) division performs sales promotion activities , which includes providing price or volume discounts and incentives to customers including retail and tele communication companies , based on explicit or implicit agreements . As disclosed in Note 2 , Material Accounting Policies , and Note 3 , Material Accounting Estimates and Ass um ptions , of the : consolidated financial statements , the Group estimates the expected expenditures and discounts resulting from sales promotion activities at the time of revenue recognition and deduct s the amount from revenue . We identified the accuracy and comple teness of sales deductions from promotional activities as a key audit matter because the calculation of sales deductions involves significant estimates and jud gements by management and is subject to possible bias or error and the amount is material to the consolidated financial statements . The primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter are as follows : Â° Eval uating the Group 's accounting policies and understanding the processes and internal controls relating to the applied to . sales deductions ; Â° Eval uating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the approval of the sales deduction policy ; Â° Eval uating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction estimates and the approval of post - sett lement adjustments ; Â° Eval uating the reason abl eness of the estimates by inspecting , on a sample basis , the documentation supporting sales deductions estimates ; and Â° Eval uating the accuracy and comple teness of sales deductions by comparing , on a sample basis , the period - end estimates to amounts settled subsequent to the period - end and examining relevant documentation . Other Matters The procedures and practices utilized in the Republic of Korea to audit such consolidated financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries . The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31 , 2024 and 20 23 have been translated into United States dollars solely for the convenience of the reader . We have aud ited the translation and , in our opinion , the consolidated financial statements expressed in Korean won have been translated into dollars on the basis set forth in Note 2 . 18 to the consolidated financial statements . Respons ibilities of Management and Those Charg ed with Govern ance for the Consolid ated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IF RS , and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material mis statement , whether due to fraud or error . In preparing the consolidated financial statements , management is responsible for assessing the Group âĢ Ļ s ability to \n\n\n r ane As part of an audit in accordance with IS As and KS As , we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit . We also : Â° Ident ify and assess the risks of material mis statement of the consolidated financial statements , whether due to fraud or error , design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks , and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material mis statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error , as fraud may involve collusion , for gery , intentional o missions , misrepresent ations , or the override âĢ Ļ of internal control . Â° Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances , but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls . Â° Eval uate the appropri at eness of accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and reason abl eness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management . Â° Con clude on the appropri at eness of management âĢ Ļ s use of the going concern basis of accounting and , based on the audit evidence obtained , whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group âĢ Ļ s ability to continue as a going concern . If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists , we are required to draw - attention in our aud itors âĢ Ļ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or , if such disclosures are inadequate , to modify our opinion . Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our aud itors âĢ Ļ report . However , future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern . . Eval uate the overall presentation , structure and content of the consolidated financial statements , including the disclosures , and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation . Â° Ob tain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements . We are responsible for the direction , supervision and performance of the group audit . We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion .

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity , or areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 . - 24 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 2 Changes in Accounting Policies and Dis cl osures ( A ) New and amended standards adopted by the Company The Company applied the following amended standards for the first time for the annual reporting period comm encing on January 1 , 2024 : , Amendments to Korean IF RS 100 1 , Present ation of Financial Statements The amendments to Korean - IF RS 100 1 clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non - current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and that the classification is unaffected by management âĢ Ļ s intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability . The amendments also introduce a definition of settlement to make clear that settlement includes the transfer to the counter party of the entity 's own equity instruments , however , it would be excluded if an option to settle the liability by the transfer of the entity âĢ Ļ s own equity Â© instruments is recognized separately from the liability as an equity component of a compound financial instrument . The adoption of the amendments does not have a significant impact on the Company âĢ Ļ s consolidated financial statements . Amendments to Korean IF RS 111 6 , Le ases The amendments add requirements for the subsequent measurement of sale - and - lease back transactions that are accounted for as sales in accordance with Korean IF RS 111 5 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The amendments require the seller - les see to calculate the âĢ ĺ lease payments âĢ Ļ or âĢ ĺ re vised lease payments âĢ Ļ in a way that does not result in the seller - les see recognizing any gain or loss for the rights of use that the seller - les see continues to retain after the lease comm ences . The adoption of the amendments does not have a significant impact on the Company âĢ Ļ s consolidated financial statements . Amendments to Korean IF RS 100 7 , Statement of Cash Fl ows , and 110 7 , Financial Instruments : Present ation The amendments to Korean IF RS 100 7 , Statement of Cash Fl ows , introduce new disclosures , such as terms and conditions , balance payment due dates and the effects on cash flows , to help users of the financial statements to assess the effects of supplier financing arrangements on an entity âĢ Ļ s liabilities and cash flows .

( A ) Non - cont rolling interests Each component of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributable to the owners of the parent and the non - controlling interests , and total comprehensive income is attributable to the owners of the parent and the non - cont rolling interests , even if the non - cont rolling interests have a negative balance . ( B ) Elim ination of inter company transactions Inter company transactions , balances , income and expenses and unreal ized gains and losses ( excluding foreign exchange gains and losses ) are eliminated on consolidation . The Company âĢ Ļ s share of unreal ized losses on transactions with associates accounted for using the equity method are eliminated in the same way as unreal ized gains unless there is evidence of impairment of the asset . 2 . 4 Functional and Present ation Currency ( A ) Functional and presentation currency The Company measures the items included in the financial statements of each component using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each it operates ( âĢ ľ functional currency âĢ Ŀ ). The functional currency of the parent company is Korean won ( KR W ) and the consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won ( KR W ). ( B ) Translation into the presentation currency The results and financial position of all entities subjected to consolidation that have a functional currency different from the parent âĢ Ļ s presentation currency are translated into the parent âĢ Ļ s presentation currency as follows : ( 1 ) Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting date . ( 2 ) Income and expenses in the statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates for the period . However , if this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions , the transactions are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transactions . ( 3 ) Exchange differences arising on translation in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above are recognized in other comprehensive income . - 26 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 5 Cash and Cash Equ ival ents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand , deposits held at call with banks , and highly liquid short - term investment assets that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value . 2 . 6 Financial Assets ( A ) Classification Financial instruments are classified based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset . The Company considers the contractual terms of the relevant financial instrument and assess es whether the contractual cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount âĢ Ŀ outstanding . ( B ) Imp air ment The Company assess es the expected credit losses of debt instruments carried at am ort ized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income on a forward - looking basis . However , the Company applies the simplified approach for trade rece iv ables , which requires expected credit losses to be recognized over the life of the rece ivable from initial recognition . 2 . 7 Trade Rece iv ables Trade rece iv ables are recognized at initial transaction price , unless they contain a significant financing component , and are subsequently measured at am ort ized cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment . 2 . 8 In vent ories The Company determines the unit cost of invent ories , except for materials in transit , using the average cost method . The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials , direct labor , other direct costs and related production over heads based on normal operating capacity , excluding the cost of idle production equipment and scra pping costs . The Company measures invent ories at the lower of cost and net real izable value . Net real izable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the applicable variable selling expenses , and reflects the decrease in selling price , the increase in costs to completion , or decrease in value due to excess or obsolete inventory . - 27 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 9 Property , Plant and Equipment Dep reciation of property , plant and equipment begins when assets are considered by management to be available for their intended use , such as in the production of products . The Company âĢ Ļ s property , plant and equipment is dep reci ated on a straight - line method over the estimated useful lives of the âĢ Ŀ assets , less any residual values . Land is not dep reci ated . Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition , construction of a qualifying asset , including capital ized interest costs , are dep reci ated over the estimated useful lives . The estimated useful lives of property , plant and equipment used by the Company for each asset category are as follows : Estimated useful lives Buildings and structures 15 , 30 years Mach inery and equipment 5 years Other 5 years 2 . 10 Int angible Assets Good will represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of subsidiaries , associates and joint ventures , businesses and other entities acquired at the date of acquisition and is recognized as an intangible assets in respect of acquisitions of businesses of subsidiaries and as an investment in associates and joint ventures in respect of acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures . Int angible assets , other than goodwill , are initially recognized at their historical cost and are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated am ort ization and accumulated impairment losses . Membership rights are regarded as intangible assets with indefinite useful life and not am ort ized as there are no foreseeable restrictions on their use . However , whenever there is an indication of impairment , such as a decline in the market value of membership rights , a reasonable estimate is made to reflect the impairment . Int angible assets with finite useful lives , such as patents , trademarks and other intangible assets , are am ort ized on a straight - line method over their estimated useful lives . The estimated useful lives of intangible assets used by the Company are as follows : Estimated useful lives Pat ents , trademarks and other intangible assets 3 - 25 years 2 . 11 Financial Li abilities The Company class ifies financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities and recognizes them on the consolidated statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to a contract , depending on the substance of the contractual terms . - 28 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 12 Employee Benefits The Company operates various types of post - employment benefit plans , including defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans . The defined benefit liability ( ass et ) recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets , less any deficit ( ex cess of plan assets over the asset recognition threshold ) and is calculated annually by an independent Â° act uary using the projected unit credit method . 2 . 13 Income Tax Exp ense The global minimum top - up tax in accordance with the P ilar Two tax legislation is subject to Korean IF RS 101 2 , Corporate Income Tax . The Company accounts for the amount of global minimum top - up tax as a current tax when it is incurred , and applies the exception for the recognition and disclosure of deferred income tax related to the global minimum top - up tax . The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries , associates and joint ventures , except where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future . Def erred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences arising on these assets only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized . 2 . 14 Der iv ative Instruments The Company recognizes its rights and obligations under derivative contracts as assets and liabilities at fair value and records gains and losses on these contracts in the statement of profit or loss . However , effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hed ges are deferred in equity . The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting for hed ges of risks including changes in the price of invent ories . The effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income , while the ineffective portion is recognized in âĢ ĺ financial income âĢ Ļ or âĢ ĺ financial expense âĢ Ļ . - 29 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 15 Revenue Recogn ition The Company âĢ Ļ s revenue primarily represents the fair value of the consideration received or rece ivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the Company âĢ Ļ s activities . Revenue is net of value - added tax , returns , sales incentives , discounts and others . ( A ) Identification of performance obligations The Company is required to transfer control of goods and services under contracts with customers . For the export of products and goods under Inc oter ms Group C terms ( such as C IF ), the Company recognizes the transportation services ( including insurance ) provided after the control of the goods has passed to the customer as a separate performance obligation . ( B ) Performance obligations satisfied at a point of time The Company âĢ Ļ s revenue is primarily derived from the sale of goods and is recognized when control of the goods passes to the customer . ( C ) Performance obligations satisfied over time The Company recognizes revenue over time for sales of software , transportation services , installation services , and etc . where the customer has direct control over the outcome during the performance of the service . ( D ) Variable consideration The Company provides a variety of sales promotions including incentives , promotion and sales allowances . Where these sales promotion policies result in variability in the consideration promised to customers , the Company estimates the variable consideration using either the expected value or the most likely amount whichever method the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled . The estimate of variable consideration is included in transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant portion of the cumulative revenue already recognized will not be reversed when the related uncertainties are resolved . Revenue and contract liabilities are recognized when the related revenue is earned or when the decision to pay the variable consideration to the customer is made , whichever is later . The Company recognizes contract liabilities ( ref und liabilities ) after the sale of products to customers by estimating the return rate using the expected value methods based on historical experience . When the customer exercises its right to return the product , the Company recognizes the asset as a refund asset and adjusts cost of sales by the amount of the right to collect the product from the customer . The right to collect the product is measured by deduct ing the cost of collecting the product from the historical carrying amount of the product . - 30 - \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 16 Le ases ( A ) L essee accounting The Company applies the practical exped ient of Korean IF RS 111 6 , Le ases , and does not separate the non - lease elements from the lease elements and accounts for the non - lease elements relating to each lease element as a single lease element . At the commencement date of a lease , the Company recognizes a right - of - use asset ( the lease asset ) representing the right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments . The right - of - use asset is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as âĢ ĺ property , plant and equipment âĢ Ļ and the lease liability is presented as âĢ ĺ current portion of long - term liabilities âĢ Ļ or âĢ ĺ long - term borrow ings . âĢ Ļ Le ase liabilities are measured at the inception of the lease at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at that date , discounted at the Company âĢ Ļ s incremental borrowing rate . For short - term leases ( lease terms of 12 months or less at the inception of the lease ) and low value assets ( under lying assets of USD 5 , 000 or less ), lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight - line basis over the lease term applying the simplified practical exped ient . ( B ) L essor accounting The Company , as a less or , determines whether a lease is a finance or an operating lease at the inception of the lease . Le ases that transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases and all leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases . Le ase income from operating leases is recognized on a straight - line basis over the lease term , while initial direct costs incurred during the negotiation and contracting phase of an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and exp ensed over the lease term against the lease income . 2 . 17 Government Grants Government grants relating to revenues are deferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the same period in which they are matched with revenues or expenses related to the purpose for which the grant was made . Government grants received related to the acquisition of assets are treated as deferred income and credited to the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the useful lives of the related assets . 2 . 18 Con ven ience Translation into United States Dollar Amount s The US dollar amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements represent supplementary information solely for the convenience of the reader . \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 3 . Material Accounting Estimates and Ass um ptions The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future . Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and future events that are reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances . These estimates may differ from actual results . The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are as follows . ( A ) Revenue recognition The Company recognizes a liability for a product return and a right to the returned goods that are expected to be returned by customers following the sale of products to customers . At the point of sale , the Company estimates the return using the expected value method based on accumulated experience at the portfolio level and the Company âĢ Ļ s revenue is affected by changes in the expected return . Revenue from the sale of goods recognized at the point of transfer of control is the contractual consideration less consideration paid to customers in relation to certain sales promotion activities . Based on the historical experience and terms of contracts , the Company makes reasonable estimates of the sales deductions which affect the Company âĢ Ļ s revenue ( B ) Provision for warranty The Company provides warranties for products sold . At the end of each reporting period , the Company recognizes a provision for warranties based on its best estimate of the amount it believes is necessary to provide for future and current warranty obligations . These best estimates are based on historical experience . ( C ) Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using various valuation techniques and assumptions based on market conditions prevailing at the end of each reporting period . ( D ) Imp air ment of financial assets In measuring the allowance for impairment losses on financial assets , the Company makes assumptions about the risk of default and expected credit rates . In making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculations , the Company makes judgment based on past experience and current and forecast of future economic conditions at the reporting date . ( E ) Le ase In determining the lease term , the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option , or not to exercise a termination option . The period covered by the renewal option ( or the period covered by the termination option ) is included in the lease term only if it is reasonably certain that the les see will exercise ( or not exercise ) the renewal option . The lease term is reass essed when the option is actually exercised ( or not exercised ) \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S ( F ) Net defined benefit liabilities ( assets ) The net defined benefit liabilities ( assets ) are dependent on a number of factors which are determined using actu arial methods based on a number of assumptions . Among the assumptions used to determine the net defined benefit liabilities ( assets ) is the discount rate , and changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying amount of the net defined benefit liability ( ass et ). At the end of each year the Company determines an appropriate discount rate , taking into account the interest rates on high - ' quality corporate bonds , which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash out flows expected to be required to settle the net defined benefit liability ( ass et ). Some other key assumptions relating to the net defined benefit liability ( ass et ) are based on current market conditions . ( G ) Imp air ment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful life The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment annually . The recover able amount of a cash - gener ating unit or asset , including goodwill , is determined based on a value - in - use calculation . These calculations - are based on estimates . ( H ) Income taxes Income taxes on the Company âĢ Ļ s taxable income are calculated by applying tax laws and decisions of tax authorities in various countries , and , therefore , there is uncertainty in determining the final tax effect . The Company has recognized current and deferred tax based on its best estimate of the tax consequences expected to be payable in future periods as a result of the Company âĢ Ļ s operating activities up to the reporting date . However , the actual future final tax liability may not be consistent with the related assets and liabilities recognized , and such differences may affect the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when the final tax effect is determined . The Company is subject to additional income taxes , calculated in accordance with the method prescribed by tax laws , when a certain amount is not used for investment , wage growth , etc eter a , in a given period . The related tax effect is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income taxes for the period , and the amount of income tax payable by the Company depends on the level of investment , wage growth , etc eter a in each year , resulting in uncertainty in determining the final tax effects .

Financial Risk Management The Company manages its financial risks with a focus on minimizing market risk , credit risk , liquidity risk and others arising from its operating activities . To this end , the Company closely monitors and responds to each risk factor . The Company establishes global financial management standards and manages the risks by periodically measuring customer âĢ Ļ s | and counterpart ies âĢ Ļ financial risk , applying currency hed ges , and reviewing cash flows . The Company also manages foreign exchange risk by monitoring foreign exchange rate fluctuations through local financial centers in the major regions ( United States , United Kingdom , Singapore , China , Brazil , and Russia ), which act as an agent for the subsidiaries in each region to manage foreign exchange transactions . In addition , local finance centers in the major regions respond to liquidity risk through a region ally integrated financial structure . The Company âĢ Ļ s financial assets subject to financial risk management consist of cash and cash equivalents , short - term financial âĢĶ instruments , financial assets at am ort ized cost , trade rece iv ables and others , while its financial liabilities consist of trade pay ables , borrow ings , and others . ( A ) Market risk ( 1 ) | Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from its global operations through transactions in currencies other than its functional currency . The main currencies in which the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk are the US dollar and European Euro . The Company focuses on minimizing the impact of foreign exchange fluct uation by matching levels of assets and liabilities den ominated in each foreign currency . To minimize exchange position , the Company âĢ Ļ s foreign exchange management policy requires normal business transactions , including import and export , as well as financing transactions such as depos iting and borrowing , to be in local currency or match as closely as possible cash infl ows and out flows incurred in the respective foreign currencies . This reduces but does not eliminate the foreign exchange risk to which the Company is exposed . Moreover , the Company periodically evaluates and monitors the foreign exchange risk to efficiently mitigate such risk , and the speculative foreign exchange transactions are strictly prohibited . As of December 31 , 2024 and 20 23 , the impact on profit or loss ( before tax ) of a 5 % change in exchange rates on the Company âĢ Ļ s financial assets and financial liabilities den ominated in a major foreign currency other than the functional currency would be as follows : December 31 , 2024 December 31 , 20 23 In millions of Korean won Increase Decre ase Increase Decre ase USD 365 , 273 ( 365 , \n\n\n Samsung Electronics Co ., Ltd . and its subsidiaries NOT ES TO THE CONS OL ID ATED FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S ( 2 ) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk for floating interest rate financial instruments can be defined as the risk of changes in the fair value of components of the statements of financial position due to changes in the market interest rates , and the risk of changes in the future cash flows of interest income and expenses arising from investing and financing activities . The Company âĢ Ļ s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from interest - bearing deposits and floating interest rate debt obligations , and the âĢ Ŀ Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk to minimize uncertainty and cost of financing resulting from changes in interest rates . As of December 31 , 2024 and 20 23 , the effect on profit or loss before tax of a 1 % p change in interest rates on the Company âĢ Ļ s variable rate financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date would have been as follows : December 31 , 2024 December 31 , 20 23 In millions of Korean won Increase Decre ase Increase Decre ase Financial assets 141 , 671 ( 141 , 671 ) 210 , 617 ( 210 , 617 ) Financial liabilities ( 5 , 702 ) 5 , 702 ( 6 , 197 ) 6 , 197 Net effect 135 , 969 ( 135 , 969 ) 204 , 420 ( 204 , 420 ) ( 3 ) Price risk The Company âĢ Ļ s investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in equity instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss , which is in line with the Company âĢ Ļ s strategy . As of December 31 , 2024 and 20 23 , price fluct uation of market able equity securities ( listed stocks ) by 1 % would result in changes in other comprehensive income ( before income tax ) of W 76 , 8 65 million and W 52 , 510 million , respectively , and changes in profit before tax of 4 86 2 million and W 3 , 472 million , respectively . ( B ) âĢĶ Credit risk Credit risk arises during the normal course of transactions and investing activities where customers or other parties fail to discharge an obligation . The Company monitors and sets the customer âĢ Ļ s and counter party âĢ Ļ s credit limit on a periodic basis based on their financial conditions , default history and other factors . Ad equ ate insurance coverage is maintained for trade rece iv ables related to trading partners situated in higher risk countries . Credit risk can arise from transactions with financial institutions including financial instrument transactions such as cash and cash equivalents , deposits , and derivative instruments .

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include : * Qu oted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments - The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date , with the resulting value discounted to present value Other techniques , such as discounted cash flow analysis , bin omial distribution model , etc eter a , are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments . For trade and other rece iv ables that are classified as current assets , the book value approx imates a reasonable estimate of fair value .

The Directors further accept responsibility for the\nmaintenance of accounting records that may be relied upon in the preparation of financial statements as\nwell as adequate systems of internal financial control.\n\nNothing has come to the attention of the Directors to indicate that the company will not remain a going\nconcern for at least twelve months from the date of this statement.\n\nOlaogun Badru Atanda Hanwant Singh Arora\nDirector Director\n\f\n\n\n© GrantThornton\n\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\n\nTo the Shareholders of Ranbaxy Nigeria Limited\nReport on the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOpinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Ranbaxy\nNigeria Limited (the Company), which comprise the\nStatement of Financial Position as at 31 March 2021, and\nthe Statement of Profit or Loss, Statement of Changes in\nEquity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year then\nended, and notes to the financial statements, including a\nsummary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as at 31 March 2021, and of its financial\nperformance and its cash flows for the year then ended in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRSs), the Financial Reporting Council of\nNigeria Act No. 6, 2011 and the provision of the Companies.\n\nand Allied Matters Act, 2020.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International\nStandards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under\nthose standards are further described in the Auwditor’s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of\nour report. We are independent of the Company in\naccordance with the International Ethics Standards Board\nfor Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants\n(IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and\nthe IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we\nhave obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a\nbasis for our opinion.\n\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged\nwith Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair\npresentation of the financial statements in accordance with\n\nIFRSs, and for such internal control as management\ndetermines is necessary to enable the preparation of\nfrom material\n\nfinancial statements that are free\n\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial\nstatements, management is\nresponsible for assessing the\nCompany’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern,\ndisclosing, as applicable,\nmatters related to going\nconcern and using the going\nconcern basis of accounting\nunless management either\nintends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or\n\nhas no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for\noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\n\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial\nStatements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements as a whole are free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to\nissue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not\na guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs\nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they\ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic\nde\nstatements.\n\n \n\nions of users taken on the basis of these financial\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism\nthroughout the audit. We also:\n\f\n\n\niii)\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit\nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain\naudit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to\nprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from\nfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as\nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of\ninternal control.\n\nObtain an understanding of internal control\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the\ncircumstance, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control.\n\n \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting\npolicies used and the reasonableness of accounting\nestimates and related disclosures made by\nmanagement.\n\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s\nuse of the going concern of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions\nthat may cast significant doubt on the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern. If we\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are\nrequired to draw attention in our auditor’s report\nto the related disclosures in the financial statements\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our\nopinion.

The Company name was changed to Ranbaxy Nigeria\nLimited at an extra ordinary general meeting held on 6 October, under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap\nC.20, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, The Company is a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited- India\nuntil March 2015, when Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (RLL) merged with the SUN Pharmaceutical Industries Limited,\nIndia. Ranbaxy Netherland BV (RNBV), a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited ( RLL) India holds 86.16% of the\nordinary share capital of the Company, with effect from 28 July 2017, the name Ranbaxy Netherland BV was changed\nto Sun Pharma (Netherlands) B.V.\n\nThe financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They have been prepared under\nthe assumption that the company operates on a going concern basis. The company’s audited balances for the year\nunder review are comparable with the prior year balances in all aspects.\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 (including comparatives) were approved and authorised\nfor issue by the board of directors of Ranbaxy Nigeria Limited on... 2021.\n\n \n\n3 New or Revised Standards or Interpretations\n\n3.1 New Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards adopted as at 1 April 2020\n\nThe Company adopted the following standards and amendments that are effective for the first time in\n01 April 2020:\n\n+ Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\n\n+ Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)\n\n+ Amendments to IAS 1 presentation of financial statements\n\n+ Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors\n\n+ Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures — Interest rate benchmark reform\n\n+ Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial instruments\n\nThese amendments do not have a significant impact on these financial statements and therefore the disclosures have\nnot been made. However, they do not affect these financial statements.\n\n3.2 Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not\nbeen adopted early by the Company.\n\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new IFRS standards, amendments and\ninterpretations to existing standards have been published by the IASB but are not yet effective, and have not been\nadopted early by the company. Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the\ncompany's accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement.\n\n14\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\nNew or Revised Standards or Interpretations (Cont'd)\n\n3.2.1 Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not\nbeen adopted early by the Company (Cont'd)\n\nInformation on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the company's\nfinancial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not\nexpected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements.\n\nObscuring information\n\nBy including the concept of ‘obscuring information’ in the new definition, the IASB intends to address concerns that the\ndefinition could be perceived by stakeholders to focus only on information that cannot be omitted (material\ninformation), but not on why the inclusion of immaterial information could potentially mislead the users of the financial\nstatements. The amendments explain that information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a\nsimilar effect as omitting or misstating the information.\n\n3.2.2 The amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1) issued\non 23 January 2020 (effectives 01 January 2022)\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the IASB issued ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\"\nproviding a more general approach to the classification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the contractual\narrangements in place at the reporting date. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2022.\n\nThe amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1) affect only the\npresentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position — not the amount or timing of recognition of any asset,\nliability income or expenses, or the information that entities disclose about those items. They are:\n\nclarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at\nthe end of the reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the “right” to defer\nsettlement by at least twelve months and make explicit that only rights in place “at the end of the reporting period”\n\nclarify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement\nof a liability; and\n\nmake clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or\nservices.\n\n3.2.3 IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts ', Issued: May 2018 (Effective 1 January 2021)\n\nIFRS 17, “Insurance Contracts\" In May 2018, the IASB issued IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts,\" which replaces an\ninterim standard IFRS 4 \"Insurance Contract\" and related interpretations. The standard sets out the requirements that\na company should apply in reporting information about insurance contracts.\n\nThe standard provides update of information about the obligations, risk and performance of insurance contracts,\nincreases transparency in financial information reported by insurance companies, which will give investors and\nanalysts more confidence in understanding the insurance industry, and introduces a consistent accounting for all\ninsurance contracts based on a current measurement model. IFRS 17 requires that a company update the\nmeasurement of insurance obligations at each reporting date, using current estimates of the amount, timing and\nuncertainty of cash flows and of discount rate.\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\n4 Significant Accounting Poli\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in the financial statements.\n\n \n\nies\n\n4.1 Basis of Preparation\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost\nconvention. Monetary amounts are expressed in Nigerian Currency Naira (N).\n\n4.2 Foreign Currency Translation\n4.2.1 Functional and presentation currency\n\nThese financial statements are presented in Nigeria Naira (N) which is the company's functional currency. Except\notherwise indicated. All financial information presented in Nigeria Naira has been rounded to the nearest thousand\nexcept where otherwise stated.\n\n4.2.2 Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective entities, using the exchange\nrates prevailing at the dates of the transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting\nfrom the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement of monetary items denominated in foreign\ncurrency at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nNon-monetary items are not retranslated at year-end and are measured at historical cost (translated using the\nexchange rates at the transaction date), except for non-monetary items measured at fair value which are translated\nusing the exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.\n\n4.3 Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the services are transferred to the customer at\nan amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.\nRevenue arises mainly from manufacture, imports and sale of pharmaceutical products to customers in Nigeria.\n\nTo determine whether to recognize revenue, the Company follows a 5-step process:\n\n(i) Identifying the contract with a customer\n\n(ii) Identifying the performance obligations\n\nDetermining the transaction price\n\n(iv) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations\n\n(v) Recognizing revenue when/as performance obligation(s) are satisfied.\n\n \n\nThe Company manufactures, imports and sells pharmaceutical products in the wholesale market. Sales are\nrecognised based on invoices raised on or before the 24th day of each months for up- country customers (i.e\ncustomers outside Lagos) and on or before 28th day of each month for local customers (i.e. customers within Lagos).\nAll invoices raised after these dates are recognised when control of products has transferred, being when the products\nare delivered to the wholesaler, the wholesaler has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and\nthere is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the wholesaler's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when\nthe products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to\nthe wholesaler, and either the wholesaler has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the\nCompany has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. The product is often sold with\nretrospective allowance for sales returns based on 0.5% of the aggregate sales over a 12 months period.\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4.3 Revenue Recognition (Cont'd)\n\nRevenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified on the invoice, net of estimated volume\ndiscounts(/if any). Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the sales returns, using the expected\nvalue method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not\noccur. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of 30 days, which is\nconsistent with market practice. The Company's obligation to provide a refund for returned products under the\nstandard terms is recognised as a provision.\n\nThe Company often enters into transactions involving a range of the Company's pharmaceutical products. In all\ncases, the total transaction price for a contract is allocated amongst the various performance obligations based on\ntheir relative stand-alone selling prices.\n\nRevenue is recognized either at a point in time or over time, when (or as) the Company satisfies performance\nobligations by transferring the promised services to its customers.\n\nThe company recognizes contract liabilities for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance\nobligations and reports these amounts as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. Similarly, if the\nCompany satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the consideration, the Company recognizes either a\ncontract asset or a receivable in its statement of financial position, depending on whether something other than the\npassage of time is required before the consideration is due.\n\n4.4 Finance Income/ Finance Cost\nFinance income and finance income represent interest income on fund invested. Interest income is recognised as it\naccrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.\n\nFinance costs comprise interest expense on borrowing. Interest expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss,\nusing the effective interest method.\n\nForeign currency gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a net basis as either\nfinance income or finance cost depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or net loss\nposition.\n\n4.5 Operating\nOperating expenses are recognized in statements of profit or loss upon utilization of the service or as incurred.\n\n4.6 Borrowing Cost\n\nBorrowing Cost directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a\nsubstantial period of time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as\nthe assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable\nin the income statements in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n4.7 Income and deferred tax\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss\nexcept to the extent of items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates\nstatutorily enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\n17\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4,7 Income and deferred tax (Cont'd)\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for\nfinancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the initial\nrecognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither\naccounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nDeferred tax asset is recognized in profit or loss account except to the extent that it relates to a transaction that is\nrecognized directly in equity. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits will be available against which the amount will be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it\nis no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse,\nbased on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to\nincome taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to\nsettle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously\n\n4.8 Property, plant and equipment\n\n4.8.1 Recognition and measurement\nItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and\naccumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Property, plant and equipment\nunder construction are disclosed as capital work-in-progress. The cost of self-constructed asset includes the cost of\nmaterials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their\nintended use including, where applicable, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on\nwhich they are located and borrowing costs on qualifying assets.\n\nPurchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of the equipment.\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate\nitems (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as\nseparate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\n4.8.2 Derecognition\n\nThe carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future\neconomic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nGains and losses on derecognition or disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by\ncomparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment, and are\nrecognised net in profit or loss.\n\n4.8.3 Subsequent costs\nThe cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the\nitem if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the company and its cost\ncan be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day\nservicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n18\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4.8 Property, plant and equipment (Cont'd)\n\n4.8.4 Depreciation\nDepreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for\ncost, less its residual value.\nDepreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an\nitem of property, plant, and equipment which reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic\nbenefits embodied in the asset. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives\nunless it is reasonably certain that the company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term in which case the\nassets are depreciated over the useful life.\n\nDepreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it\nto be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:\n\n- Leasehold improvements Over the period of the lease\n- Plant and machinery 10 -15 years\n\n= Motor 4-6 years\n\n= Furniture and fittings 5-7 years\n\n- Generators 4-6 years\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if\nappropriate.\n\n4.9 Intangible Assets\n\n4.9.1 Recognition and measurement\nThe cost of an intangible asset is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with\nthe item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n4.9.2 Derecognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefit are expected from the use. Gain\nor losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal\nproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n4.9.3 Subsequent costs\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embedded in the specific\nasset to which it relates. All other expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or\nloss as incurred.\n\n4.9.4 Amortisation\n\nAmortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.\nAmortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line bases over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets,\nother than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern\nof consumption of the future economic benefits embedded in the asset.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the current year are as follows\n\nComputer software 5 years\nAmortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if\nappropriate.\n\n19\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4.8 Property, plant and equipment (Cont'd)\n\n4.9.5 Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment\nFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent\ncash inflows (cash generating units). As a result, some impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the\ncarrying assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.. All other\nindividual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount\nexceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in use. To determine the\nvalue-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a\nsuitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\nThe data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the entity's latest approved budget, adjusted as\nnecessary to exclude the effects of future reorganizations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined\nindividually for each cash-generating unit and reflect management's assessment of respective risk profiles, such as\nmarket and asset-specific risks factors. amount of any assets allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining\nimpairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all\nassets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognized may no longer\nexist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit's recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.\n\n4.10 Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventory include purchase cost\nand all relevant costs that have been incurred in bringing the items of inventory to their present location and\nobligation. Inventories comprise of finished products and goods-in-transit.\n\nThe basis of costing is as follows:\nRaw materials: Raw materials includes purchase cost and other costs incurred to bring the materials to their location\nand condition. Raw materials are valued using weighted average cost.\n\n \n\nFinished products: Purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis including transportation and applicable delivering\ncharges.\n\nGoods in transit: Purchase cost incurred to date.\n\nNet realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be\nincurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\n\n4.11 Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and Cash Equivalents comprise of notes on hand, demand deposits and other short term, highly liquid financial\nassets with original maturities of three months or less that are convertible to a known amount of cash which are\n‘subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, all of which are available for use by the company unless otherwise\nstated.

A financial liability is derecognized\nwhen it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.\n\n4.12.2 Classification and initial measurement of financial assets\n\nExcept for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the\ntransaction price in accordance with IFRS 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for\ntransaction costs (where applicable).\n\n \n\nFinancial assets, other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments, are classified into the following\ncategories:\n\n+ Amortized cost\n+ Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n+ Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nIn the periods presented the corporation does not have any financial assets categorized as FVOCI.\n\nThe classification is determined by both:\n+ The entity's business model for managing the financial asset.\n+ The contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\nAll income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognized in profit or loss are presented within finance\ncosts, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of trade receivables which is presented within\nother expenses.\n\n4.12.3 Subsequent measurement of financial assets\n\n4.12.3.1 Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost if the assets meet the following conditions (and are not designated\nas FVTPL):\n\n+ they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets and collect its contractual cash\nflows.\n\n+ the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest,\non the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is\nomitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company's cash and cash equivalents, trade and most\nother receivables fall into this category of financial instruments as well as listed bonds that were previously classified\nas held-to-maturity under IAS 39.\n\n4.12.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial assets that are held within a different business model other than ‘hold to collect’ or ‘hold to collect and sell’\nare categorized at fair value through profit and loss. Further, irrespective of business model financial assets whose\ncontractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest are accounted for at FVTPL. All derivative\nfinancial instruments fall into this category, except for those designated and effective as hedging instruments, for\nwhich the hedge accounting requirements apply.\n\n21\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\nFinancial instruments (Cont'd)\n\n4.12.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) (Cont'd)\n\nAssets in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of\nfinancial assets in this category are determined by reference to active market transactions or using a valuation\ntechnique where no active market exists.\n\n4.12.3.3 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\nThe Company accounts for financial assets at FVOCI if the assets meet the following conditions:\n\n+ they are held under a business model whose objective it is “hold to collect” the associated cash flows and\nsell and\n\n+ the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAny gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) will be recycled upon derecognition of the asset.\n\nFinancial assets classified as available for sale (AFS) under IAS 39 (comparative periods) AFS financial assets are\nnon-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for inclusion in any of the\nother categories of financial assets (FVTPL or held to maturity and loans and receivables).\n\nWithin equity, except for interest and dividend income, impairment losses and foreign exchange differences on\nmonetary assets, which are recognised in profit or loss. When the asset was disposed of or was determined to be\nimpaired, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income was reclassified from the equity\nreserve to profit or loss. Interest calculated using the effective interest method and dividends were recognised in profit\nor loss within finance income.\n\n4.12.4 Impairment of financial assets\n\nIFRS 9's impairment requirements use more forward-looking information to recognize expected credit losses — the\n‘expected credit loss (ECL) model’. This replaces IAS 39's ‘incurred loss mode'’. Instruments within the scope of the\nnew requirements included loans and other debt-type financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI, trade\nreceivables, contract assets recognized and measured under IFRS 15 and loan commitments and some financial\nguarantee contracts (for the issuer) that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nRecognition of credit losses is no longer dependent on the Company first identifying a credit loss event. Instead the\nCompany considers a broader range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses,\nincluding past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability\nof the future cash flows of the instrument.\n\nIn applying this forward-looking approach, a distinction is made between:\n\n+ financial instruments that have not deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition or that have low\ncredit risk (‘Stage 1’) and\n\n+ financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk\nis not low (‘Stage 2’).\n\n+ would cover financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date (Stage 3’).\n\nTwelve month expected credit losses’ are recognized for the first category while ‘lifetime expected credit losses’ are\nrecognized for the second category. Measurement of the expected credit losses is determined by a probability-\nweighted estimate of credit losses over the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\nMeasurement of the expected credit losses is determined by a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the\nexpected life of the financial instrument.\n\n22\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4.12.5 Trade and other receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Company makes use of a simplified approach in accounting for trade and other receivables as well as contract\nassets and records the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are the expected shortfalls in\ncontractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. In\ncalculating, the Company uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to\ncalculate the expected credit losses using a provision matrix.\n\nThe Company assess impairment of trade receivables on a collective basis as they possess shared credit risk\ncharacteristics they have been grouped based on the days past due.\n\n4.12.6 Classification and measurement of financial lial Ss\n\nAs the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same under IFRS 9 compared to IAS 39, the Company's\nfinancial liabilities were not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 9. The Company's financial liabilities include borrowings,\ntrade and other payables and derivative financial instruments.\n\n   \n\nSubsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for\nderivatives and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or\nlosses recognised in profit or loss (other than derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as\nhedging instruments).\n\nAll interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are reported in profit or loss\nare included within finance costs or finance income.\n\n4.12.7 Trade and other payables\n\nTrade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of\nbusiness from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less\n(or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.\n\n4.12.8 Trade and other payables (Cont'd)\nTrade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective\ninterest method.\n\n4.13 Prepayments and advances a\n\nPrepayments and advances are non-financial assets which result when payments are made in advance of the receipt\nof goods or services. They are recognised when the company expects to receive future economic benefits equivalent\nto the value of the prepayment. The receipt or consumption of the goods or services results in a reduction in the\nprepayment and a corresponding increase in expenses or assets for that reporting period.\n\n4.14 Borrowing\nBorrowings are recognised initially at their issue proceeds and subsequently stated at cost less any repayments.\nTransaction costs where immaterial, are recognised immediately in the income statements. Where transaction costs\nare material, they are capitalised and amortised over the life of the loan. Interest paid on borrowing is recognised in\nthe income statement for the period.\n\n4.15 Post-employment benefits\n\n4.15.1 Defined contribution plan\n\n‘A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan (pension fund) under which the company pays fixed\ncontributions into a separate entity. The company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if\nthe fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current\nand prior years.\n\n23\n\f\n\n\nRANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (CONT'D)\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies (Cont'd)\n\n4.15 Post-employment benefits (Cont'd)\n\n4.15.1 Defined contribution plan (Cont'd)\n\nIn line with the provisions of the Pension Reform Act, the company has instituted a defined contribution pension\nscheme for its permanent staff. Staff contributions to the scheme are funded through payroll deductions while the\ncompany’s contribution is recognized in profit or loss as employee benefit expense in the years during which services\nare rendered by employees. Employees contribute 8 % each of their Basic salary, Transport and Housing Allowances\nto the Fund on a monthly basis. The company’s contribution is 10 % of each employee's Basic salary, Transport and\nHousing Allowances.\n\n4.15.2 Defined benefit plan\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is determined using the projected unit credit method, with\nactuarial valuations being carried out periodically so that a provision for the present value of the estimated cost for\nliabilities due at the reporting date in respect of employee's terminal gratuities based on qualifying years of service and\napplicable emoluments as per operating collective agreement is being made in the statement of financial position.\n\n4.15.3 Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are recognized as an expense and liability at the earlier of when the company can no longer\nwithdraw the offer of those benefits and when the company recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope\nof IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involve the payment of termination of benefits.\nIf benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting year, then they are discounted to their present value.\n\n4.15.4 Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related\nservice is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the\nCompany has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the\nemployee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n4.15.5 Gratuity Scheme\nThe employee gratuity scheme is a defined benefit plan, as at the reporting date, 31 March 2021; a memorandum of\nunderstanding was reached on the 24th February 2021 between the Management of Ranbaxy Nigeria Limited and In-\nHouse workers of the National Union of Chemical, Footwear, Rubber, Leather and Non-metallic Products Employees\n(NUCFRLANMPE) to discontinue the defined benefit Scheme.\nThe following agreement was reached:\n\n+ Both parties agreed on 5% compound interest rate on cumulative shall be from 2008 to 31 March 2019;\n\n+ Other cases already paid/settled is closed and cannot be revisited by this agreement;\n\n+ That there shall be no victimization and intimidation from both parties as a result of this agreement.\nTo this effect provision for gratuity has been made in the books to settle employees who meet the requirement to\nreceive benefits based on the Company's policy.

Any amounts received\nover and above the par value of the shares issued is classified as ‘share premium’ in equity. Incremental costs directly\nattributable to the issue of equity instruments are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.\n\n4.17 Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\n4.17.1 Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the company has a present legal or constructive obligation that\ncan be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the\nobligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the\ndiscount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognized when the company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan,\nand the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not\nprovided for.\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the company from a\ncontract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured\nat the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of\ncontinuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the company recognizes any impairment loss on the\nassets associated with that contract.\n\n4.18 Contingent liabilities\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only\nby the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the\ncompany, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an\noutflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or the amount of the\nobligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not recognized as\nliabilities in the statement of financial position. If the likelihood of an outflow of resources is remote, the possible\nobligation is neither a provision nor a contingent liability and no disclosure is made.\n\n4.19 Related parties\n\nRelated parties include the holding company and other group entities. Directors, their close family members and any\nemployee who are able to exert a significant influence on the operating policies of the company are also considered to\nbe related parties.

Management is\ncontesting vigorously the claims of Borex insisting that most of the items claimed for had already\nbeen paid for. Management has requested for both parties to meet and reconcile their accounts\nsince 2013 but Borex refused to attend the meetings.

Management insists that it never\nengaged the services of the claimant for the said structural drawings and design and it had no\ncontractual relationship with them. In the opinion of the Solicitors, the claimant has not shown any\nevidence of being contracted by Ranbaxy. As there is no privity of conract between the parties, the\nclaim will not succeed.\n\n(iii) Ranbaxy Nig. Ltd Vs Feccox & Gen. Ent. Ltd (ID/ADR/575/2017)\nThis is a counter-claim for ¥10,000,000.00 being unpaid incentives, soiled and unsupplied goods\nto Feccox Pharmacy. The Management is contesting that the counter-claim is statute bared as it\narose from years 2005 - 2010 and case filed in 2017. In the opinion of the Solicitors, the counter-\nclaim cannot succed since it is statute bared.\n\n(iv) Keleko M. Aderemi Vs Ranbaxy Nig.

A contract is , or contains , a lease if the contract conve ys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration . To assess whether a contract conve ys the right to control the use of an identified asset , the Company assess es whether : ( i ) the contract involves the use of an identified asset ( ii ) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and ( iii ) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset . At the commencement date of a lease , the Company recognizes a liability to make lease payments ( i . e , the lease liability ) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term ( i . e , the right - of - use asset ). Right - of - use assets are measured at cost , less any accumulated depreciation , impairment losses and adjusted for any re - me asure ment of lease liabilities . The cost of right - of - use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before the commencement date . Right - of - use assets are dep reci ated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets . IF ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise Of a purchase option , depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset . The Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term . The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company . In calculating the present value of lease payments , the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date . After the commencement date , the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the acc retion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made . In addition , the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re - me asured if there is a modification or a change in the lease term . The Company separately recognizes the interest expense on the lease liability as Finance cost and the depreciation expense on the right - of - use asset .

Investment property is measured initially at its cost , including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs . Sub sequent expenditure is capital ized to the asset 's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably . All other repairs and maintenance costs are exp ensed when incurred . Investment properties are dep reci ated using the straight - line method over their estimated useful lives which are 40 years . Though the Company measures investment property using cost based measurement , the fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes . Fair values are determined based on an annual evaluation performed by an accredited external independent val uer . Investment properties are de recogn ized either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected From their disposal . The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss in the period of de - recogn ition .

Sub sequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement , the Company class ifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories : e those to be measured subsequently at fair value ( either through other comprehensive income , or through profit or loss ), and e those measured at am ort ized cost . The classification depends on the entity 's business model for managing the Financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows . For assets measured at fair value , gains and losses will either be recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss or other comprehensive income . For investments in debt instruments , this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held . For investments in equity instruments , this will depend on whether the Company has made an irre voc able election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through \n\n\n Corporate Overview S ustain ability and Us Stat utory Reports | Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31 , 2024 ( 1 ) Fair value through Profit or Loss ( F VT PL ) Assets that do not meet the criteria for am ort ized cost or F V OC I are measured at fair value through profit or loss .

Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income . D ere c ogn ition A financial asset is de recogn ized only when : e the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired , or e the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash Fl ows to one or more recipient Where the entity has transferred an asset , the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset .

Financial liabilities are initially measured at the am ort ized cost unless at initial recognition , they are classified as fair value through profit or loss .

Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that the likelihood of out flow of resources is remote , no provision or disclosure is made . ( m ) Revenue from operations m mm 248 Sale of goods The Company 's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers . Sales are recorded at the time control of the products is transferred to trade customers , in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products . Control is the ability of trade customers to direct the use of and obtain the benefit from our products . In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers , the Company considers transfer of significant risks and rewards of products and the probability of flowing of future economic benefit to the Entity as per the terms of the Contract which usually coincide with the delivery of the goods . Revenue is measured on the basis of contracted price and reduced by variable consideration . Variable consideration includes sales returns , trade discounts , volume based incentives , and cost of promotional programs , indirect taxes as may be applicable . The Company provides volume based incentives to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified in the contract . In cent ives are offset against amounts payable by the customer . To estimate & recognize a liability For the incentives , the Company applies methods which best predicts the amount of incentive and is primarily driven by the number of volume thresholds contained in the contract . The volume incentive is estimated at contract inception and recognized when it is highly probable that significant revenue reversal will not occur . Company 's contracts with trade customers do not have significant financing components or non - cash consideration and the Company does not have unb illed revenue or significant amounts of prep ay ments From customers . The company pays sales commission to _ its employees for contract that they obtain for sales of goods and immediately exp ensed out sales commissions ( in cluded under employee benefits ). Contract balances Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration ( or an amount of consideration is due ) from the customer . If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer , a contract liability is \n\n\n Corporate Overview S ustain ability and Us Stat utory Reports | Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31 , 2024 V v .

It also\nmanages the Group and, as the Group parent company,\nensures the effectiveness of legal, organizational and\ncompliance-related functions throughout the Group.\n\nThe Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz\nGroup AG have been prepared in accordance with the\naccounting principles of the German Commercial Code\n(HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG);\nthe amounts shown are in millions of euros (€) and the\ncomparable figures for the year ended 31 December\n2022 are also shown.\n\nThe items summarized in the balance sheet and the\nincome statement are listed individually and explained\nin these notes.\n\nFor the sake of materiality, clarity and transparency, the\nsystem of presentation of the balance sheet has been\nmodified in accordance with Section 266 of the HGB.\nOther receivables and other assets include in particular\nreceivables from associated companies. Other provi-\nsions comprise provisions for taxes and miscellaneous\nprovisions. Other liabilities comprise liabilities to asso-\nciated companies, loans and bonds, liabilities to finan-\ncial institutions and miscellaneous liabilities.\n\nThe income statement has been prepared according to\nthe internationally predominant cost-of-sales method.\nThe system of presentation according to Section 275 of\nthe HGB has been modified to improve clarity with\nregard to financial activities.\n\nFinancial activities are presented as net income/\nexpense from investments in subsidiaries and associ-\nated companies, net interest income/expense and net\nother financial income/ expense. The other financial\nincome/expense includes in particular income and\nexpenses from Group financing. These are mainly deriv-\natives that are used primarily to hedge risks between\nGroup companies.\n\nDue to the existing control and profit-and-loss-transfer\nagreements, the profits and losses arising at these\nGerman subsidiaries are in general taken over by\nMercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2023\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nResponsibility\n\nRecognition and measurement\n\nIntangible assets are measured at cost of acquisition,\nreduced by systematic straight-line and unscheduled\namortization. They have a useful life of three to fifteen\nyears.\n\nThe capitalization option for self-produced intangible\nassets is not utilized\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost\nof acquisition, reduced by systematic and unscheduled\ndepreciation.\n\nSystematic straight-line depreciation for technical\nequipment and machinery and other equipment, factory\nand office equipment is based on a useful life of two to\ntwenty-three years.\n\nImpairments are recognized for intangible assets and\nproperty, plant and equipment if the asset has to be\nmeasured at a lower value.\n\nAssets with cost of acquisition of up to €1,000 are\nimmediately expensed.\n\nShares in subsidiaries and associated companies are\nmeasured at the cost of acquisition, or, if there is an\nindication of permanent impairment, at the lower fair\nvalue. If the reasons for permanent impairment are no\nlonger given, the impairment is reversed.\n\nLoans bearing low interest or no interest are measured\nat their present value. In accounting for non-cash con-\ntributions, the exchange principles are generally\napplied and the newly acquired shares are measured at\nthe carrying amount of the shares contributed\n\nReceivables and other assets are measured at their\nnominal values with consideration of recognizable risks.\nIf they have a remaining term of more than one year and\nare non-interest bearing, they are discounted to their\npresent value on the balance sheet date.\n\nA general value adjustment to the receivables is recog-\nnized to reflect the general credit risk.\n\nReceivables and other assets with a remaining term of\none year or less which are denominated in foreign cur-\nrencies are translated at the spot rates on the balance\nsheet date.\n\nNon-current receivables and other assets denominated\nin foreign currencies are translated at the spot rates on\nthe date when booked or at the lower rate on the bal-\nance sheet date.\n\nSecurities presented under current assets are meas-\nured at the lower of cost of acquisition or fair value on\nthe balance sheet date.\n\nThe liquid funds are recognized at their nominal value\non the balance sheet date\n\nPayments made prior to the balance sheet date that\nconstitute expenses for a specific period after that date\nare reported as prepaid expenses. Any difference\nbetween the settlement amount and the lower issue\namount of a liability is capitalized and amortized sys-\ntematically over the period of the liability.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2023\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nResponsibility\n\nThe subscribed capital is recognized at nominal value.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated on temporary differ-\nences in the measurement of assets, liabilities, accruals\nand deferrals between the tax basis and financial\nreporting according to HGB, as well as on tax-loss car-\nryforwards. Tax-loss carryforwards can only be taken\ninto account if they can be offset against taxable\nincome within the statutory period of five years\n\nDeferred taxes are measured based on the combined\ntax rate of 29.825% for the income-tax fiscal unity of\nMercedes-Benz Group AG. The combined tax rate\nincludes corporate income tax, trade tax and the soli-\ndarity surcharge. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax\nliabilities are netted. Any resulting tax liability is recog-\nnized as a deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.\nAny resulting tax asset is not recognized in the balance\nsheet, as no use is made of the capitalization option.\n\nIn December 2021, the OECD published guidelines for\na new global framework for minimum tax levels with\nthe objective of preventing base erosion and profit\nshifting (BEPS) by large multinational enterprises. As\nof the balance sheet date, the BEPS Pillar 2 Rules\nwere transferred into German law by the law on ensur-\ning a global minimum level of taxation for multina-\ntional enterprise groups (Mindeststeuergesetz - Min-\nStG) and apply to Mercedes-Benz Group AG with effect\nfrom 1 January 2024.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, an analysis of possible\neffects on the company has not identified any countries\nwhich could give rise to material effects with respect to\nthe possible introduction of a minimum tax level.\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations result\nfrom the offsetting of pension obligations and assets\nthat are not available to all other creditors and serve\nexclusively to settle pension obligations (special-pur-\npose assets).\n\nPension obligations resulting from pension plans that\nprovide for a predefined benefit in old age are recog-\nnized at the settlement amount required according to\nreasonable business judgement. Measurement is based\non the actuarial projected unit credit method. Discount-\ning of pension obligations is based on the average mar-\nket interest rate of the past ten financial years as pub-\nlished on 31 December 2023 by the German central\nbank (Deutsche Bundesbank) for an assumed remaining\nterm of 15 years.\n\nPension obligations resulting from pension plans which\nat least guarantee the contributions paid in are recog-\nnized at the fair value of the related assets, as this\nexceeds the guaranteed minimum amount. Future\nclaims are related to the fair value of the assets (securi-\nties or comparable assets)\n\nThe offset assets are measured at fair value.\n\nExpenses and income resulting from discounting the\npension obligations are offset against the expenses and\nincome of the offset assets under net interest income/\nexpense. All other components of pension expenses are\npresented under functional costs.\n\n\n\nMercedes-Bel\n\nAnnual Financial Statements\n\nContent Balance Income Sta\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nOther pro ns are recognized at the required settle-\nment amounts in accordance with reasonable commer-\ncial judgement. Expected future increases in prices and\ncosts until settlement of the liabilities are taken into\nconsideration.\n\nProvisions with a remaining term of more than one year\nare discounted according to the net method over that\nperiod using the average market interest rate of the\npast seven financial years as published by the German\ncentral bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Changes in the\ndiscount rate or interest effects of a changed estimate\nof the remaining term are presented under interest\nincome/expense.\n\nOther provisions also include provisions for taxes. In\nparticular for the case that the amounts stated in the\ntax returns might not be realized (uncertain tax posi-\ntions), the provisions are based on the best estimate of\nthe expected tax payments. Tax refund claims are only\nrecognized in the balance sheet if they are sufficiently\ncertain.\n\nIn accordance with Section 254 of the HGB, derivative\nfinancial transactions are linked as a hedging relation-\nship with an underlying transaction, provided there is a\ndirect hedging context between the financial transac-\ntion and the underlying transaction. Financial transac-\ntions for which no units of valuation are formed are\nmeasured individually at fair value. Any resulting unreal-\nized losses are expensed.\n\nLiabilities are measured at their settlement amounts\non the balance sheet date.\n\nLiabilities denominated in foreign currencies with a\nremaining term of up to one year are translated at the\nspot rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nNon-current liabilities denominated in foreign curren-\ncies are translated at the spot rates on the date when\nbooked or at the higher rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nPayments received prior to the balance sheet date that\nconstitute income for a specific period after that date\nare reported as deferred income.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements\n\nt Balanc\n\nSchedule of non-current assets\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nCost of acquisition or production\n\nuditor's Report\n\nResponsibilit\n\nDepreciation/Amortization/Write-ups\n\n12\n\n‘atement\n\nCarrying amount\n\nO1Jan.

Financial assets\n\nShares in subsidiaries and associated companies\nincreased by €504 million to €38,844 million (2022:\n€38,340 million).\n\nThe additions of shares in subsidiaries are due to non-\ncash contributions of the shares of Mercedes-Benz\nInternational Finance B.V. and Mercedes-Benz Capital\nNederland B.V. in Mercedes-Benz AG, which resulted in\nthe carrying amount of the investment in Mercedes-\nBenz AG being increased by the same amount. The\nadditions also relate to a capital repayment from the\n2022 financial year that was taken back at Mercedes-\nBenz Bank AG and capital increases at Mercedes-Benz\nMobility AG.\n\nThe disposals of shares in subsidiaries include in par-\nticular the non-cash contributions of the shares of\nMercedes-Benz International Finance B.V. and\nMercedes-Benz Capital Nederland B.V. in Mercedes-\nBenz AG.

As instruments of share-\nbased payment with cash settlement, the PPSP are\nmeasured at their fair values on the balance sheet date.\nThey are paid out at the end of their contractually\ndefined periods; an earlier, proportionate payout is only\npossible under certain conditions when a beneficiary\nleaves the company. PPSP 2019 was paid out as\nplanned in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nPerformance Phantom Share Plan\n\nIn 2023, Mercedes-Benz Group AG adopted a Perfor-\nmance Phantom Share Plan similar to that used in prior\nyears, under which eligible board members and\nemployees are granted phantom shares entitling them\nto receive cash payments after four years, provided that\n\ntement\n\npredefined targets are met in the three-year perfor-\nmance period. The amount of cash paid to eligible per-\nsons is based on the number of vested phantom shares\n(determined depending on the extent to which specific\nkey figures are achieved over a three-year performance\nperiod) multiplied by the quoted price of Mercedes-\nBenz Group's ordinary shares (calculated as an average\nprice over a specified period at the end of the four-year\nplan period). The determination of target achievement\nis based on relative share performance, which meas-\nures the performance development of Mercedes-Benz\nGroup shares compared with the development of a per-\nformance index based on a group of competitors\nincluding the Mercedes-Benz Group, and the return on\nsales (ROS) of the Mercedes-Benz Group compared with\nthe average revenue-weighted RoS of a group of com-\npetitors. Beginning with PPSP 2023, environmental,\nsocial and governance (ESG) targets are included in the\ntarget achievement, thereby driving forward the sus-\ntainable realignment and sustainable long-term devel-\nopment of the Group. From PPSP 2023, overall target\nachievement will be determined based on the weighted\nachievement of the financial targets (relative share per-\nformance and RoS) and the ESG targets over the three-\nyear performance period. The achievement of the finan-\ncial targets accounts for 80% and the achievement of\nthe ESG targets for 20% of the overall target achieve-\nment of the PPSP.\n\nFor the plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, special regulations\napply to the members of the Board of Management to\nthe extent that the Mercedes-Benz Group has to\nachieve a higher RoS than the average of its\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\ncompetitors in order to obtain the same target achieve-\nment that the other plan participants obtain in the case\nof a RoS equal to the average of the competitors.\n\nDuring the four-year period between the allocation of\n\nthe preliminary phantom shares and the payout of the\nplan at the end of the period, the phantom shares earn\na dividend equivalent in the amount of the actual divi-\ndend paid on ordinary Mercedes-Benz Group shares.\n\n9.

Life expec-\ntancy is calculated on the basis of the Heubeck 2018 G\nmortality tables. The mortality tables take into account\nthe latest statistics of the statutory pension insurance\nand the Federal Statistical Office. In addition, the meas-\nurement is based on annual increases in the cost of liv-\ning and annual increases in future entitlements of\n2.20% (2022: 2.20%) and expected annual wage and\nsalary increases of 3.00% (2022: 3.00%).\n\nThese obligations are offset against the special-purpose\nassets, which as of 31 December 2023 have a fair value\nof €1,152 million (2022: €1,060 million) and cost of\nacquisition of €1,238 million (2022: €1,256 million).\n\nThe obligations for the pension plans, the amounts of\nwhich are determined by the fair value of securities or\ncomparable assets, are recognized with the fair value of\nthose assets at 31 December 2023 of €127 million\n(2022: €102 million), as this exceeds the guaranteed\nminimum value of the obligations at 31 December 2023.\nThere is then an offset with those special-purpose\nassets that have original cost of acquisition of €122 mil-\nlion (2022: €103 million). As a result, this leads to the\nfull offsetting of the obligations with the related special\npurpose assets.\n\nThe assets offset at 31 December 2023 include the\nshares shown in the following table in foreign funds in\nthe form of shares in an investment-fund company with\nvariable equity of more than 10% pursuant to Sections\n108 to 123 of the German Capital Investment Act\n(KAGB). This is a private equity fund with an interna-\ntional focus that reflects individual investor needs.\nThere are no restrictions on the possibility of returning\nthe shares on stock-exchange trading days.

Revenue\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG generates revenue primarily\nfrom the provision of internal services by corporate\nfunctions. These services are charged to the companies\nof the Group. From these services, the company gener-\nated revenue of €1,282 million in the past financial year\n(2022: €1,163 million).\n\nMoreover, the company provides services for Daimler\nTruck Holding AG and its subsidiaries. The revenue gen-\nerated from these services amounted to €133 million in\nthe past financial year (2022: €259 million).\n\nDomestic revenue (€1,203 million) accounts for 85% of\ntotal revenue, with 15% coming from abroad (€212 mil-\n\nlion). The revenue generated outside Germany is attrib-\nutable in particular to Europe (€75 million), Asia\n\n(€74 million) and America (€53 million).\n\n13. Functional costs\n\nCost of sales includes the expenses incurred to gener-\nate sales revenue. These are mainly personnel\nexpenses, the cost of purchased services, IT expenses,\ndepreciation, and rental and lease expenses. Cost of\nsales of €1,400 million (2022: €1,407 million) was at the\nlevel of the previous year.\n\nGeneral administrative expenses primarily comprise\npersonnel expenses, IT costs and fees for expertise and\nconsulting. The administrative expenses amounted to\n€779 million (2022: €752 million), slightly above the pri-\nor-year figure.\n\nThe expenses for expertise and consulting include\nauditor fees.

These shares were subsequently trans-\nferred to Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust e.V; in the year\n2022, Mercedes-Benz Group AG generated other oper-\nating income of €242 million from this transaction.\n\nOther operating income of €23 million (2020: €70 mil-\nlion) is attributable to other reporting periods and\nrelates mostly to the refund of VAT for previous years\nand the interest income arising from this as well as\nincome from the release of provisions.\n\n15.

Derivative financial instruments\nand valuation units\n\nAs part of its centralized Group financing, Mercedes-\nBenz Group AG concludes derivative financial instru-\nments with external financial institutions. These finan-\ncial instruments serve solely to hedge risks relating to\nforeign exchange rates and interest rates and to hedge\ncommodity prices. They cover the original financial\ntransactions (underlying transactions) and are placed\ntogether with them as far as possible in valuation units.\n\nOn the balance sheet date, derivative financial instru-\nments had a nominal amount of €167,486 million. In\naddition to external derivative financial instruments, this\nalso includes derivative financial instruments that are\nmirrored internally and passed on to Group companies.\n\nFinancial instruments in a total amount of €61,215 mil-\nlion serve as hedging instruments in valuation units.\nOf that total, €46,264 million is accounted for by for-\neign-exchange contracts and €14,951 million by inter-\nest-rate contracts.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Si\n\nContent\n\ntatement\n\nGroup AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nThe derivative financial instruments held by Mercedes-\nBenz Group AG have the nominal values at the end of\nthe reporting year and the prior year as shown in the\nfollowing table.

In\naddition, forward exchange contracts and currency\nswaps are held to hedge financial receivables and liabil-\nities from Group financing. The interest rate hedging\ncontracts include interest rate swaps and interest rate/\ncurrency swaps. They are primarily used to minimize the\nrisk of changes in interest rates. During the financial\nyear, the commodity forwards comprised commodity\nswaps, which were charged on to companies of the\nGroup through internal derivatives.\n\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of derivative finan-\ncial instruments at the end of the reporting year and the\nprior year are shown in the following table.\n\nDerivative financial instruments: carrying amounts/fair values\n\n31 Dec. 31 Dec.\n2023 2022\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\namount value amount value\nIn millions of euros\nAssets\nForeign exchange con-\ntracts - 2,419 2 2,292\nInterest rate contracts 13 1,538 24 2,427\nCommodity forward\ncontracts - - - 1\n13 3,957 26 4,720\nLiabilities\nForeign exchange\ncontracts -99 -2,378 43 2,223\nInterest rate contracts -388 -961 595 1,691\nCommodity forward\ncontracts - - - 1\n~487 -3,339 -638 3,915\nBalance “474 618 -612 805\n\nThe carrying amounts are taken from the items of the\nbalance sheet and primarily relate to other provisions.\nThe decrease in provisions particularly affects interest\nswaps in connection with Group financing. Other\namounts relate to other assets and other liabilities.\n\nInterest-rate hedges result in other assets from prema-\nturely terminated valuation units. In addition, other\nassets and other liabilities result from advance pay-\nments made and received for interest-rate/currency\nswaps. Other provisions also include negative fair val-\nues and fair-value changes of derivatives not included\nin valuation units as well as negative ineffectiveness\nfrom valuation units.\n\nThe fair values of currency forwards are determined on\nthe basis of current European Central Bank reference\nrates with consideration of forward premiums or dis-\ncounts. The fair values of interest-rate contracts are\ndetermined on the basis of discounted expected future\ncash flows with the use of the market interest rates\napplicable for the remaining time until maturity of the\nfinancial instruments. The fair values of commodity for-\nwards are determined on the basis of current spot rates\non commodity exchanges with consideration of forward\npremiums or discounts.\n\nThe following table shows the hedged exchange-rate,\ninterest-rate and commodity-price risks included in val-\nuation units.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements Mercedes-Bel\n\nContent Balance Income Sta\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nIndepen\n\n2nt Auditor's ponsibilit\n\nIf derivative financial instruments are included in valua-\ntion units with the related underlying transactions, an\neffectiveness measurement is carried out both at the\nbeginning of the hedging period and on each following\nbalance sheet date upon which the hedge exists.\n\nIn connection with the hedging of exchange-rate risks\nof assets and liabilities, the conditions and parameters\nof the underlying transaction and the hedging transac-\ntion are compared with each other. With the hedging of\nmirror derivatives, effectiveness is automatically\nensured due to the mirroring. The risk management sys-\ntem at the Mercedes-Benz Group monitors the effec-\ntiveness of hedges.\n\nDerivative financial instruments: valuation units\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG generally applies the net\nhedge presentation method for its valuation units. Inso-\nfar as changes in fair value resulting from the measure-\nment of open hedges are offset by changes in the value\nof the underlying transactions, these derivatives are not\nrecognized in the balance sheet; the corresponding off-\nsetting changes in the value of hedges and underlying\ntransactions are therefore not recognized in profit or\nloss for the period. Provisions are recognized for any\nadditional ineffectivities in the event of losses.\n\nForeign-exchange contracts\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG uses derivative financial\ninstruments for currency hedging. In addition, opposing\nintra-Group hedging contracts, which are based on the\nsame hedging rates as the external derivatives, are\n\nconcluded with subsidiaries. These external and inter-\nnal derivatives are combined to form valuation units\n(microhedges). In economic terms, the positive or nega-\ntive effects from currency hedging thus largely occur at\nother companies of the Group.\n\nForward exchange contracts for financing activities out-\nside the Group are combined with opposing hedges\nconcluded to form valuation units (microhedges). Pro-\nvided that the documentation requirements are fulfilled,\ncurrency forwards with Group-external counterparties\nthat are not matched by corresponding hedges within\nthe Group can be included in valuation units (micro-\nhedges) with the related financial receivables and liabil-\nities. The hedging period is generally one to four years.\n\nType of risk\n\nType of hedge\n\n31 Dec.2023\n\nHedged volume Positive fair value Negative fair value\n\nIn millions of euros\n\nExchange-rate risk / interest-rate risk Liability hedges 1,237 18 -\nOpposing derivative hedges 8,964 238 -37\n\nMacrohedges 4,750\" - -415\n\nExchange-rate risk Asset and liability hedges - - -\nOpposing derivative hedges 46,264 463 -1,815\n\n61,215 719 -2,267\n\n1 Hedges in a total nominal amount of €9,500 million are designated as macrohedges.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nInterest rate contracts\n\nValuation units (microhedges) are formed for group-ex-\nternal interest swaps and interest/currency swaps\nwhich have opposing hedges concluded with subsidiar-\nies. Interest-rate contracts that are not opposed by any\ncorresponding hedges are included in valuation units\nwith the related financial receivables and liabilities,\nprovided that the documentation requirements are ful-\nfilled (microhedges). If groups of derivatives are in an\neconomic relationship with a risk-offsetting effect, they\nare combined — if applicable with a related financial\nreceivable or liability — in valuation units (macro-\nhedges), for example, in the case of volume- or\ntime-proportionate smoothing of existing derivatives.\nThe hedging period is one to a maximum of thirteen\nyears.\n\nCommodity forward contracts\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG concludes Group-external\nderivative financial instruments for raw-material hedg-\ning. In addition, opposing intra-Group hedging con-\ntracts, which are based on the same hedging rates as\nthe external derivatives, are concluded with subsidiar-\nies. These external and internal derivatives are com-\nbined to form valuation units (microhedges) and are\nshown in the balance sheet using the net hedge pres-\nentation method. In economic terms, the positive or\nnegative effects from raw-material hedging thus occur\nat other companies of the Group. The company has\ndecided to suspend these hedging strategies for\n\nprecious metals until further notice. The previously\nexisting hedges have expired.\n\n23. Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities relate to potential future events,\nthe occurrence of which would lead to an obligation. At\nthe balance sheet date, the contingent liabilities of\nMercedes-Benz Group AG were reviewed with consider-\nation of available knowledge about the financial posi-\ntion, cash flows and profitability of business partners\nwith regard to the risk situation. Based on past devel-\nopments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG assesses the risk of\npossible claims on all the listed obligations as unlikely.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, contingent liabilities amounted\nto €73,519 million (2022: €70,658 million), primarily\nconsisting of sureties and guarantees. They include\nsureties and guarantees to domestic and foreign sub-\nsidiaries amounting to €73,193 million (2022:\n\n€70,164 million), which primarily comprise guarantees\nprovided to creditors of subsidiaries of Mercedes-Benz\nGroup AG, for example, for loans they have taken out\nand bonds they have issued and liabilities to banks.\n\nSureties and guarantees were issued to third parties in\na total amount of €2 million (2022: €37 million).\n\n24. Subsequent liability\n\nAs legal entities involved in the hive-down that took\nplace in 2019, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-\nBenz AG and Daimler Truck AG are jointly and severally\nliable pursuant to Section 133 Subsections 1 and 3 of\nthe German Transformation Act (Umw6G) for the liabili-\nties of Mercedes-Benz Group AG (then Daimler AG)\nincurred prior to the effective date of the hive-down\nThose of the aforementioned legal entities to which the\nrelevant liabilities are not assigned under the hive-\ndown agreement are liable, however, only for those lia-\nbilities if they fall due within five years of the\nannouncement of the entry of the hive-down in the\ncommercial register of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and\nclaims therefrom are established in court or in another\nmanner as described in Section 133 of the German\nTransformation Act (Umw6G).\n\nThe provisions existing in this context, in particular the\nprocedure for regulating the internal settlements\nbetween the participating legal entities, are regulated in\nthe hive-down agreement of 25 March 2019.\n\nThe aforementioned period is ten years for pension\nobligations based on the Company Pensions Act that\nexisted before the hive-down took effect. Mercedes-\nBenz Group AG does not expect any outflow of liquidity\ndue to a sufficient volume of the special-purpose\nassets being available to the other two legal entities.\n\nThe potential obligations from subsequent liability pur-\nsuant to Section 133 of the German Transformation Act\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 20:\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nResponsibility\n\n(Umw6G) and from the risks from the internal settlement\nbetween Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-\nBenz AG and Daimler Truck AG amount to €4,701 million\nfor Mercedes-Benz Group AG (thereof due in 2024:\n€1,133 million).\n\nAccording to the current appraisal, an actual cash out-\nflow from Mercedes-Benz Group AG is considered to be\nunlikely due to the assessments of the creditworthiness\nof Mercedes-Benz AG and Daimler Truck AG.\n\n25. Other financial obligations\n\nOther financial obligations total €3,899 million (thereof\ndue in 2024: €2,574 million). Of that total, €1,762 million\nrelates to subsidiaries (thereof due in 2024: €1,740 mil-\nlion).\n\nOther financial obligations resulting from rental and\nleasing agreements amount to €16 million (thereof due\nin 2024: €5 million). Of that total, €13 million relates to\nsubsidiaries (thereof due in 2024: €4 million).\n\nThe remaining financial obligations, in particular pur-\nchase commitments, are of a magnitude typical for the\nindustry.\n\n26.

Events after the reporting period\nReview of future structure of Own Retail in Germany\n\nOn 19 January 2024, the Mercedes-Benz Group\nan-nounced a comprehensive review of the structures\nof the Group’s Own Retail in Germany. The review is\nopen-ended as regards its outcome and is being con-\nducted step-by-step and individually at each retail\nlocation. The Group expects the transformation process\nto take several years. Contract negotiations with poten-\ntial buyers had not yet taken place as of the balance\nsheet date. At the present time, it is not possible to reli-\nably estimate the effects on the Annual Financial State-\nments of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n28. Legal proceedings\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are con-\nfronted with various legal proceedings, claims as well\nas governmental investigations and orders (legal pro-\nceedings) on a large number of topics, including vehicle\nsafety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services,\ndealer, supplier and other contractual relationships,\nintellectual property rights (including but not limited to\npatent infringement actions), warranty claims, environ-\nmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for\ndamages) as well as investor litigation. Product-related\nlitigation involves, among other things, claims alleging\nfaults in vehicles. Some of these claims are asserted by\nway of class actions. If the outcome of such legal pro-\nceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group or\nsuch legal proceedings are settled, the Group may\nencounter substantial financial burdens, e.g. from dam-\nages payments or service actions, recall campaigns,\nmonetary penalties or other costly actions, which would\nadversely affect the earnings of Mercedes-Benz\n\nGroup AG. Legal proceedings and related settlements\nmay also have an impact on the company’s reputation.\n\nDiesel emission behaviour: governmental\nproceedings\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously subject to\ngovernmental information requests, inquiries, investiga-\ntions, administrative orders and proceedings relating to\nvarious laws and regulations in connection with diesel\nexhaust emissions.\n\nThe corresponding activities of various authorities\nworldwide, which were already reported in the past, are\npartly ongoing, as described below. These activities\nparticularly relate to test results, the emission control\nsystems used in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or\nthe interactions of the Mercedes-Benz Group with the\nrelevant authorities as well as related legal issues and\nimplications, including, but not limited to, under appli-\ncable environmental, criminal, consumer protection and\nantitrust laws.\n\nIn the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and\nMercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements\nin the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to\nsettle civil environmental claims regarding the emission\ncontrol systems of certain diesel vehicles. These agree-\nments have become final and effective. The authorities\ntook the position that the Mercedes-Benz Group had\nfailed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control Devices\n(AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and that\nseveral of these AECDs were illegal defeat devices.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\ntent Balan Income\n\nAs part of these settlements, the Mercedes-Benz Group\nhas denied the allegations by the authorities and has\nnot admitted liability, but has agreed to, among other\nthings, pay civil penalties, conduct an emission modifi-\ncation programme for the affected vehicles and take\ncertain other measures. The failure to meet certain of\nthose obligations may trigger additional stipulated pen-\nalties. In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-Benz\nGroup paid the civil penalties\n\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the U.S. Department\nof Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz\nGroup conduct an internal investigation. The Mercedes-\nBenz Group conducted such an internal investigation in\ncooperation with the DOJ's investigation; the DOJ‘s\ninvestigation remains open. In addition, further US state\nauthorities have opened investigations pursuant to\nboth local environmental and consumer protection laws\nand have requested documents and information.\n\nIn Canada, the environmental regulator Environment\nand Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is conducting an\ninvestigation in connection with diesel exhaust emis-\nsions based on the suspicion of potential violations of,\namongst others, the Canadian Environmental Protection\nAct, as well as undisclosed AECDs and defeat devices.\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooperate with\nthe investigating authorities.\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nIn Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office\nissued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in Septem-\nber 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory\nduties, thereby concluding the related administrative\noffense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz. In July\n2021, the local court of Boblingen issued penal orders\nagainst three Mercedes-Benz employees based on,\namongst others, fraud, which have become final. The\ncriminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart pub-\nlic prosecutor's office against further Mercedes-Benz\nemployees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud\nhave meanwhile been discontinued.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor\nTransport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary\nprovisions for the EC type approvals of certain\nMercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory\nrecalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first regis-\ntration. In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the KBA\nissued further decisions regarding vehicles equipped\nwith various EU6 or EUS diesel engines. In each of\nthose cases, it held that certain calibrations of speci-\nfied functionalities are to be qualified as impermissible\ndefeat devices. Mercedes-Benz has a contrary legal\nopinion on this question and has filed timely objections\nagainst the KBA’s administrative orders and determina-\ntions mentioned above. Insofar as the KBA has not rem-\nedied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has filed lawsuits\nwith the competent administrative court to have the\ncontroversial questions at issue clarified in a court of\nlaw. Irrespective of such objections and the lawsuits\nthat are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz Group con-\ntinues to cooperate fully with the KBA. To a large extent,\n\ntement\n\nthe remedial actions requested by the KBA were devel-\noped by the Mercedes-Benz Group and assessed and\napproved by the KBA; the necessary recalls were initi-\nated. For some of the vehicles affected by the KBA’s\ndecision from December 2023, developments, exami-\nnations and approvals of the remedial measures are still\npending. It cannot be ruled out that under certain cir-\ncumstances, software updates may have to be\nreworked, or further delivery and registration stops may\nbe ordered or resolved by the company as a precau-\ntionary measure, also with regard to the used car, leas-\ning and financing businesses. In the course of its regular\nmarket supervision, the KBA routinely conducts further\nreviews of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and asks questions\nabout technical elements of the vehicles. In addition,\nthe Group continues to be in a dialogue with the Ger-\nman Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV)\nto conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions\nmatter and to further the update of affected customer\nvehicles. In light of the aforementioned administrative\norders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions\nwith the KBA and the BMDV, it cannot be ruled out\ncompletely that additional administrative orders may be\nissued in the course of the ongoing and/or further\ninvestigations. Since 1 September 2020, this also\napplies to other responsible authorities of other mem-\nber states and the European Commission, which con-\nduct market surveillance under the new European Type\nApproval Regulation and can take measures upon\nassumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of\nthe original type approval, and also to the British mar-\nket surveillance authority DVSA (Driver and Vehicle\nStandards Agency).\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned authorities, authori-\nties of various foreign states, particularly the South\nKorean Ministry of Environment and the South Korean\ncompetition authority (Korea Fair Trade Commission)\nare conducting various investigations and/or proce-\ndures in connection with diesel exhaust emissions. In\nthis context, these South Korean authorities have made\ndeterminations and imposed sanctions against\nMercedes-Benz which Mercedes-Benz has appealed. In\nthe same context, national antitrust authorities of vari-\nous countries are also conducting investigations,\nincluding the South Korean antitrust authority, which\nhas made certain findings and imposed fines on some\ncar manufacturers. In February 2024, the criminal pro-\nceeding in South Korea was concluded.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate\nwith the authorities and institutions.\n\nDiesel emission behaviour: consumer actions and\nother lawsuits in the United States, Germany and\nother states\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection Com-\nmission of Hillsborough County, Florida in September\n2020, the plaintiff claimed that, amongst others,\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and MBUSA had violated\nmunicipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and\nother conduct by using alleged devices claimed to\nimpair the effectiveness of emission control systems.\nThe lawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022.\nThe plaintiff's appeal to this decision was dismissed in\nthe third quarter of 2023. The decision is final, and the\nproceedings are concluded.\n\nConsumer class actions were filed against Mercedes-\nBenz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as\nagainst Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group\ncompanies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in\nthe Netherlands since June 2020, in Portugal as well as\nsince November 2022 in Australia. The plaintiffs inter\nalia assert that the Mercedes-Benz Group had used\ndevices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of\nemission control systems in reducing nitrogen-oxide\n(NOx) emissions and which cause excessive emissions\nfrom vehicles with diesel engines. Furthermore, they\nclaim that Mercedes-Benz Group AG deceived consum-\ners in connection with advertising Mercedes-Benz die-\nsel vehicles. The proceedings in England and Wales\nconsist of several individual lawsuits that have been\nconsolidated into a class action. A class action lawsuit\n\nis also pending in Scotland. In these proceedings, alleg-\nedly injured parties must actively register for the\nenforcement of claims (opt-in). The plaintiffs in the con-\nsumer class action in England and Wales also allege,\namong other things, anti-competitive behaviour relating\nto technology for the treatment of diesel exhaust emis-\nsions.\n\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehi-\ncles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of\nsales contracts. They assert that the vehicles contained\nillegal defeat devices and/or showed impermissibly\nhigh emission or consumption values. They refer in par-\nticular to the KBA’s recall orders (see above). Although\nthe number of pending cases is declining, a future\nincrease cannot be ruled out. Based on similar allega-\ntions, the Federation of German Consumer Organiza-\ntions (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.V.) filed a\nmodel declaratory action (Musterfeststellungsklage)\nagainst Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the Stuttgart\nHigher Regional Court in July 2021. Such an action seeks\na ruling that certain preconditions of alleged consumer\nclaims are met. Following a decision of the European\nCourt of Justice in the first quarter of 2023, the German\nFederal Court of Justice ruled in the second quarter of\n2023 that vehicle purchasers are entitled to claim dam-\nages against the manufacturer if it intentionally or negli-\ngently used an inadmissible defeat device.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\ntent Balan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and the respective other\naffected companies of the Group regard the pending\nlawsuits set out above as being without merit and con-\ntinue to defend themselves against the claims.\n\nIn addition, investors from Germany and abroad have\nfiled lawsuits for damages with the Stuttgart Regional\nCourt alleging the violation of disclosure requirements\n(main proceedings) and also raised out-of-court claims\nfor damages. The investors allege that Mercedes-Benz\nGroup AG did not immediately disclose inside informa-\ntion in connection with the emission behaviour of its\ndiesel vehicles and that it had made false and mislead-\ning public statements. They further claim that the pur-\nchase price of the financial instruments acquired by\nthem (in particular Mercedes-Benz Group shares, for-\nmerly Daimler AG shares) would have been lower if\nMercedes-Benz Group AG had complied with its disclo-\nsure obligations. Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards\nthese allegations and claims as being without merit and\nwill defend itself against them. In this context, the\nStuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case\nproceedings under the German Act on Model Case Pro-\nceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Kap-\nMuG) in December 2021 (model case proceedings). The\npurpose of the model case proceedings is to reach a\ndecision that is binding for the main proceedings\n\nregarding common factual and legal questions. The\nmain proceedings before the Stuttgart Regional Court\nwill be suspended until a decision is reached on the\nquestions submitted, insofar as they cannot be dis-\nmissed independently of the questions to be decided in\nthe model case proceedings. The decision in the model\ncase proceedings is binding for the suspended main\nproceedings. Multiple investors have used the possibil-\nity to register claims in a considerable amount with the\nmodel case proceedings in order to suspend the period\nof limitation. Mercedes-Benz Group AG remains of the\nview to have duly fulfilled its disclosure obligations\nunder capital markets law and defends itself against the\ninvestors’ allegations also in these model case pro-\nceedings.\n\nOther legal proceedings\n\nStarting in July 2017, a number of class action suits were\nfiled in the United States and Canada against\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and other manufacturers of\nautomobiles as well as a number of their North Ameri-\ncan subsidiaries. Plaintiffs allege to have suffered dam-\nages because defendants engaged in anti-competitive\nbehaviour relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppli-\ners, markets, and other competitive attributes, includ-\ning diesel emissions control technology, since the\n1990s.\n\nIn June 2022, the proceedings in the United States were\ndismissed with final effect in favour of the concerned\nMercedes-Benz Group companies. Furthermore, in\n2023, several class actions in Canada were finally dis-\nmissed as the plaintiffs discontinued their claims. The\nMercedes-Benz Group also expects the remaining law-\nsuit pending in Canada to be discontinued and it will\ncontinue to defend itself against it until the discontinu-\nance is final. This development leads to a material\nreduction of the risk associated with the class actions.\nThey therefore no longer qualify for separate reporting,\nwhich is why the Mercedes-Benz Group will no longer\nreport on them in the future.\n\nAs already reported, class actions in connection with\nTakata airbags are pending in the United States, Canada\nand Israel. The lawsuits are based on allegations that,\nalong with Takata entities and many other companies\nthat sold vehicles equipped with Takata airbag inflators,\nMercedes-Benz Group companies and others were\nallegedly negligent in selling such vehicles, purportedly\nnot recalling them quickly enough, and failing to warn\nconsumers about a potential defect and/or to provide\nan adequate replacement airbag inflator. One of the\nlawsuits in the United States also asserted claims by\nautomotive recyclers who alleged injury because they\nwere not able to re-sell salvaged airbag inflators that\nare subject to the Takata recall. This claim has since\nthen been finally dismissed. Also, the remaining con-\nsumer Class action in the United States was dismissed\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nagainst Mercedes-Benz Group AG in its entirety, and\nagainst MBUSA in part. The plaintiffs have appealed the\ndismissal of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the pro-\nceedings against MBUSA are still pending. Since Febru-\nary 2023, the class actions in Canada were discontin-\nued by the plaintiffs; one of the class actions was finally\ndismissed and the formal court dismissal for the other\nclass action is still pending. Mercedes-Benz Group AG\ncontinues to regard the pending claims as being with-\nout merit, and the affected Group companies will con-\ntinue to defend themselves against the claims.\n\nSince 2022, a class action has been pending in the\nUnited States alleging claims based on a voluntary\nrecall of certain Mercedes-Benz ML-, GL- and R-Class\nvehicles produced during the 2004-2015 model years\nfor potentially corroded brake boosters. Among other\nthings, the plaintiffs allege that the brake boosters in\nsuch vehicles can corrode and lead to reduced braking\nforce. They allege failure to disclose the claimed defect\nand assert various claims. A similar class action was\nfiled in Israel. The Mercedes-Benz Group considers the\nlawsuits to be without merit and defends itself against\nthem.\n\nAccounting estimates and management judgements\nrelating to all legal proceedings\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries recognize\nprovisions in connection with pending or threatened\nproceedings to the extent an obligation is probable and\ncan be reasonably estimated. Such provisions are rec-\nognized in the Annual Financial Statements and are\nbased on estimates. Risks resulting from legal proceed-\nings sometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a\nlimited extent. Consequently, provisions recognized for\nsome legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient\nonce such proceedings have ended. The Mercedes-\nBenz Group may also become liable for payments in\nlegal proceedings for which no provisions were recog-\nnized and which, in the case of subsidiaries, may nega-\ntively affect the earnings of Mercedes-Benz Group AG\nthrough profit-and-loss-transfer agreements. Uncer-\ntainty exists with regard to the amounts or due dates of\npossible cash outflows. Although the final result of any\nsuch proceedings could materially affect the Group's\noperating results and cash flows for a particular report-\ning period, the Mercedes-Benz Group believes that it\nshould not exert a sustained influence on the Group’s\nfinancial position.\n\n29. Remuneration of the members of\nthe Board of Management and the\nSupervisory Board\n\nIndividualized information on the remuneration of the\nmembers of the Board of Management and of the\nSupervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG is dis-\nclosed in the Remuneration Report.\n\nBoard of Management remuneration\n\nThe total remuneration (excluding retirement benefit\ncommitments) granted to the members of the Board of\nManagement of Mercedes-Benz Group AG pursuant to\nSection 285 No. 9 of the German Commercial Code\n(HGB) is calculated as the total of the amounts of\n\n- The base salary in 2023,\n\n- The annual bonus for 2023 payable in 2024,\n\n- The value of the long-term share-based remuneration\n(Performance Phantom Share Plan - PPSP) at the time\n\nwhen granted in 2023 (payable in 2027), and\n\n- Taxable non-cash benefits in 2023 and other fringe\nbenefits.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nFor the share-based component of remuneration — the\nPPSP with a long-term orientation — the amount to be\npaid out can deviate significantly from the values\ndescribed, depending on the development of the\nMercedes-Benz Group AG share price and on the\nachievement of the relevant target parameters. Upward\ndeviation is limited. The component can also be zero.\nFurther information on share-based remuneration is\nprovided in the ® Equity chapter and in the Remuner-\nation Report.\n\nIn 2023, €10 million (2022: €9 million) is attributable to\nfixed, i.e. non-performance-related remuneration,\n\n€16 million (2022: €15 million to short- and medi-\num-term performance-related variable remuneration) to\nthe short-term performance-related variable remunera-\ntion component (annual bonus) and €13 million (PPSP:\n181,341 shares at €72.69) to variable performance-re-\nlated share-based remuneration components with a\nlong-term incentive effect granted in the financial year\n(2022: €8 million, 137,655 shares at €60.23). This adds\nup to a total of €39 million for 2023 (2022: €32 million).\nThe members of the Board of Management are entitled\nto a company pension. Service cost and present value\nhave been calculated with consideration of the parame-\nters used to calculate the pension obligation. The ser-\nvice cost of the pension obligation in 2023 was €2 mil-\nlion (2022: €2 million). The present value of the total\nobligation at 31 December 2023 was €22 million (2022:\n€18 million).\n\nPayments made in 2023 to former members of the\nBoard of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and\ntheir survivors amounted to a total of €20 million (2022:\n€21 million). Pension obligations for former members of\nthe Board of Management and their survivors amounted\nto €300 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: €297 mil-\nlion).\n\nIn 2023, no advances or loans were made or abated to\nmembers of the Board of Management of Mercedes-\nBenz Group AG.\n\nSupervisory Board remuneration\n\nThe total remuneration for the members of the Supervi-\nsory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in 2023 was\n€6 million (2022: €5 million). The remuneration of the\nmembers of the Supervisory Board does not include\nany performance-related variable components.\n\nWith the exception of the remuneration paid to the\nmembers of the Supervisory Board representing the\nemployees in accordance with their contracts of\nemployment, no remuneration was paid to the mem-\nbers of the Supervisory Board for services provided\npersonally beyond their board and committee activities\nin 2023, in particular for advisory or agency services.\n\nIn 2023, no advances or loans were made to members\nof the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n30.

In\naddition, we have audited the report on the situation of\nthe Company and the Group (hereinafter referred to as\n“the combined management report”), of Mercedes-Benz\nGroup AG including the combined non-financial state-\nment for the fulfilment of the Sections 289b to 289e\nand 315b to 315c HGB for the financial year from January\n1to December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the German legal regulations, we\nhave not audited the content of the elements of the\ncombined management report referred to in the “Other\ninformation” section of our auditor's report.\n\nThe combined management report includes cross-refer-\nences not foreseen by law that are marked as\n\nunaudited. In accordance with the German legal regula-\ntions, we have not audited the content of these\ncross-references and the information to which these\ncross-references relate.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained\nin the audit\n\n- the accompanying annual financial statements com-\nply, in all material respects, with the requirements of\nGerman commercial law applicable to business cor-\nporations and give a true and fair view of the assets,\nliabilities and financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and of its financial performance\nfor the financial year from January 1 to December 31,\n2023, in compliance with German Legally Required\nAccounting Principles, and\n\n- the accompanying combined management report as a\nwhole provides an appropriate view of the Company’s\nposition. In all material respects, the combined man-\nagement report is consistent with the annual financial\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements\nand appropriately presents the opportunities and\nrisks of future development. Our opinion on the com-\nbined management report does not cover the ele-\nments of the combined management report referred\n\nto in the “Other information” section of our auditor's\nreport.\n\nThe combined management report includes cross-ref-\nerences not foreseen by law that are marked as\nunaudited. Our opinion does not cover these\ncross-references and the information to which these\ncross-references relate.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 HGB,\nwe declare that our audit has not led to any reserva-\ntions relating to the legal compliance of the annual\nfinancial statements and of the combined management\nreport.\n\nBasis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial state-\nments and of the combined management report in\naccordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Reg-\nulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as the\n“EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German\nGenerally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement\nAudits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschafts-\nprifer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW).\nOur responsibilities under those requirements and prin-\nciples are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsi-\nbilities for the Audit of the Annual Financial Statements\nand the Combined Management Report” section of our\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\ntent Balan Income\n\nauditor's report. We are independent of the Company in\naccordance with the requirements of European law and\nGerman commercial and professional law, and we have\nfulfilled our other German professional responsibilities\nin accordance with these requirements. In addition, in\naccordance with Article 10 paragraph 2 letter f) of the\nEU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not pro-\nvided any non-audit services prohibited under Article 5\nparagraph 1 of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that\nthe evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appro-\npriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual\nfinancial statements and the combined management\nreport.\n\nNote on the emphasis of a particular matter\n\nWe refer to the comments of the legal representatives\nin Section on “EU Taxonomy” in the section entitled\n“non-financial declaration” that is included in the com-\nbined management report in accordance with Sections\n\n289b paragraph 1, 289c, 315b paragraph 1 and 315c HGB.\n\nThere it is stated that the EU Taxonomy Regulation and\nthe delegated act promulgated for this includes wording\nand terms that are subject to considerable uncertainty\nwith regard to their interpretation and for which clarifi-\ncations have not yet been published in all cases. The\nlegal representatives describe how they have carried\nout the necessary interpretation of the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation and the delegated acts promulgated by this.\nOn account of the immanent risk that abstract legal\nterms are subject to interpretation, the conformity of\nthe interpretation with the law is subject to uncertainty.\nOur opinion on the combined management report has\nnot been modified in this regard.\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial\n\nKey Audit Matter in the Audit of the Annual Financial\nStatement\n\nAkey audit matter is a matter that, in our professional\njudgement, was of most significance in our audit of the\nannual financial statements for the financial year from\nJanuary 1 to December 31, 2023. This matter was\naddressed in the context of our audit of the annual\nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our\nopinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion\non this matter.\n\nNon-impairment of shares in subsidiaries and\nfinancial receivables from subsidiaries\n\nPlease refer with regard to the accounting policies and\nmethods applied to the notes to the financial state-\nments in the section entitled “Accounting policies and\nmethods”. Further information on the shares in subsidi-\naries can be found in the notes to the financial state-\nments under Note 3 “Financial assets” and on the finan-\ncial receivables from subsidiaries in Note 4\n“Receivables and other assets” in the section entitled\n“Notes to the Balance Sheet” and in the combined man-\nagement report in the chapter entitled “Mercedes-Benz\nGroup AG (condensed version in accordance with the\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB))” in the subsection\nentitled “Risks and opportunities”.\n\nTHE RISK FOR THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMercedes-Benz Group AG is reporting shares in subsidi-\naries of € 32,576 million (PY: € 32,045 million) and\nfinancial receivables from subsidiaries of € 13,692 mil-\nlion (PY: € 17,935 million) as of December 31, 2023. The\nshares in subsidiaries and financial receivables from\n\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n\ntement\n\nsubsidiaries amount proportionately to 40.5% and 17.0%\nrespectively of the total assets and therefore have a\nsignificant influence on the Company's assets and lia-\nbilities.\n\nShares in subsidiaries are measured at cost of acquisi-\ntion or, in the event of probable permanent impairment,\nat the lower fair values. Receivables are measured at\ntheir nominal values, taking into account all foreseeable\nrisks.\n\nThe lower fair value as the benchmark for impairment of\nshares in subsidiaries is primarily measured, in the gen-\neral absence of market values, at the discretionary\nfuture earnings value. If the fair value is lower than the\ncarrying amount, it is investigated on the basis of quali-\ntative and quantitative criteria whether the impairment\nis expected to be permanent. In the case of financial\nreceivables from subsidiaries, the credit rating of the\ndebtor is also based on the future earnings value for\nthe respective participation. The assessment of the\nnon-impairment of shares in subsidiaries, including the\ncalculation of the fair value via the future earnings\nvalue, is complex and, as regards the assumptions\nmade, dependent to a high degree on estimations and\nassessments by the Company. This applies among other\nthings in particular to the estimation of the future finan-\ncial surpluses and long-term growth rates and the\ndetermination of the capitalisation rates.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial\n\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n\nAs a result of the macroeconomic development as a\nconsequence of the Russia-Ukraine war, increasing\nenergy costs, an increasing level of interest rates and\nhigher inflation, over the course of the 2023 financial\nyear, the degree of estimation uncertainty regarding the\nunderlying future financial surpluses remains high.\n\nThe Company did not record impairment losses on\nshares in subsidiaries in the financial year 2023 (PY: €\n504 million).\n\nThere is primarily a risk that the shares in subsidiaries\nand associated companies and financial receivables\nfrom subsidiaries and associated companies are\nimpaired.\n\nOUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nWe first of all evaluated the process for identifying indi-\ncations of possible impairment and assessed, on the\nbasis of the information obtained in the course of our\naudit, for which shares in subsidiaries and financial\nreceivables from subsidiaries there is an indication of\nthe need to recognise an impairment loss. To this end,\nwe appraised in particular the impairment test docu-\nmentation and reviewed the forecasts on the future\ndevelopment of the revenues and earnings or the\nexpected future financial surpluses of the individual\ncompanies and discussed this with those responsible\nfor the planning.\n\nOur audit procedures on the valuation of the, in our\nopinion, shares in subsidiaries and financial receivables\nfrom subsidiaries that are at risk consisted in particular\nof the assessment of whether the underlying forecasts\nof the future financial surpluses are based on appropri-\nate and reasonable assumptions. Hereby we evaluated\nthe explanations of the legal representatives regarding\nthe significant assumptions used in the planning, the\nstrategic expectations and the operative measures with\nregard to their impact on the forecasts of the future\nfinancial surpluses. We then assessed the appropriate-\nness of the significant assumptions made and the valu-\nation methods used by the Company. In order to evalu-\nate the appropriateness of the capitalisation rates with\nregard to the determination of the lower fair value, we\nin some cases involved our own valuation specialists.\nTo this end we among other things compared the under-\nlying assumptions and data providing the basis for the\ncapitalisation rate, in particular the risk-free interest\nrate, the market risk premium and the Beta factor, with\nour own assumptions and publicly available data. In\norder to take into account the existing forecast uncer-\ntainty, we furthermore in some cases investigated the\nimpact on fair value of possible changes for instance in\nthe capitalisation rate and the long-term growth rate in\nthat we calculated alternative scenarios and compared\nthese with the Company's valuation results (sensitivity\nanalysis).\n\nIn order to ensure the arithmetical correctness of the\nvaluation method used, we retraced the Company's cal-\nculations on the basis of the available budget data.\n\nOUR OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe approach providing the basis for the impairment\ntests on the shares in subsidiaries and financial receiv-\nables from subsidiaries is appropriate and is consistent\nwith the valuation principles. The Company’s assump-\ntions and data are appropriate.\n\nOther information\n\nThe legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are\nresponsible for the other information. The other infor-\nmation comprises the following elements of the com-\nbined management report, the content of which we\nhave not audited:\n\n- the combined declaration on corporate management,\nwhich is referred to in the combined management\nreport,\n\n- the disclosures in the combined management report\non the appropriateness and effectiveness of the over-\nall internal control system and the risk management\nsystem pursuant to the German Corporate Govern-\nance Codex marked as extraneous to management\nreports and unaudited,\n\n- the disclosures in the combined non-financial state-\nment in the combined management report marked as\nunaudited with regard to:\n\n- Energy consumption, CO, emissions, waste volumes\nand water consumption in production (chapter\n“Environmental concerns”),\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\nBalan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial\n\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n\n- Accident frequency at production sites (chapter\n“Employee matters”),\n\n- The key figures on the EU taxonomy in the body text\nand in the tables in the “EU taxonomy” chapter.\n\nIn accordance with our engagement, we have per-\nformed a separate assurance engagement of these\ndisclosures. With regard to the nature, scope and\nresults of this assurance engagement, we draw atten-\ntion to our assurance report dated March 14, 2024.\n\nOur opinions on the annual financial statements and on\nthe combined management report do not cover the\nother information, and consequently we do not express\nan opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion\nthereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to\nread the other information and, in so doing, to consider\nwhether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the annual financial\nstatements, with the combined management report\ninformation audited for content or our knowledge\nobtained in the audit, or\n\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nTf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other infor-\nmation, we are required to report that fact. We have\nnothing to report in this regard\n\nResponsil ies of the Legal Representatives and\nthe Supervisory Board for the Annual Financial\nStatements and the Combined Management Report\nThe legal representatives are responsible for the prepa-\nration of the annual financial statements that comply, in\nall material respects, with the requirements of German\ncommercial law applicable to business corporations,\nand that the annual financial statements give a true and\nfair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and\nfinancial performance of the Company in compliance\nwith German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In\naddition, the legal representatives are responsible for\nsuch internal control as they, in accordance with Ger-\nman Legally Required Accounting Principles, have\ndetermined necessary to enable the preparation of\nannual financial statements that are free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent\nfinancial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or\nerror.\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, the legal\nrepresentatives are responsible for assessing the Com-\npany’s ability to continue as a going concern. They are\nalso responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters\nrelated to going concern. In addition, they are responsi-\nble for financial reporting based on the going concern\nbasis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circum-\nstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore, the legal representatives are responsible\nfor the preparation of the combined management\nreport that as a whole provides an appropriate view of\nthe Company’s position and is, in all material respects,\nconsistent with the annual financial statements, com-\nplies with German legal requirements, and appropri-\nately presents the opportunities and risks of future\ndevelopment. In addition, the legal representatives are\nresponsible for such arrangements and measures (sys-\ntems) as they have considered necessary to enable the\npreparation of a combined management report that is\nin accordance with the applicable German legal require-\nments, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate\nevidence for the assertions in the combined manage-\nment report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the\nCompany's financial reporting process for the prepara-\ntion of the annual financial statements and of the com-\nbined management report.\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statements Mercedes-Bel\n\nContent Balance Income Sta\n\nto the Financial\n\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n\nponsibilit\n\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the\nAnnual Financial Statements and of\n\nthe Combined Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the annual financial statements as a\nwhole are free from material misstatements, whether\ndue to fraud or error, and whether the combined man-\nagement report as a whole provides an appropriate\nview of the Company's position and, in all material\nrespects, is consistent with the annual financial state-\nments and the knowledge obtained in the audit, com-\nplies with the German legal requirements and appropri-\nately presents the opportunities and risks of future\ndevelopment, as well as to issue an auditor's report\nthat includes our opinions on the annual financial state-\nments and the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but\nis not a guarantee, that an audit conducted in accord-\nance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation\nand in compliance with German Generally Accepted\nStandards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated\nby the Institut der Wirtschaftspriifer [Institute of Public\nAuditors in Germany] (IDW) will always detect a mate-\nrial misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud\nor error and are considered material if, individually or in\nthe aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the\nbasis of these annual financial statements and this\ncombined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain pro-\nfessional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement\nof the annual financial statements and of the man-\nagement report, whether due to fraud or error, design\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those\nrisks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The\nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement result-\ning from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting\na material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud\nmay involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal con-\ntrols.\n\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant\nto the audit of the annual financial statements and of\narrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the\naudit of the management report in order to design\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-\nstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies\nused by the legal representatives and the reasonable-\nness of estimates made by the legal representatives\nand related disclosures.\n\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the use by the\nlegal representatives of the going concern basis of\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence\nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists\n\nrelated to events or conditions that may cast signifi-\ncant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncer-\ntainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the\nauditor's report to the related disclosures in the\nannual financial statements and the combined man-\nagement report or, if such disclosures are inadequate,\nto modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions\nare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the\ndate of our auditor's report. However, future events or\nconditions may cause the Company to cease to be\nable to continue as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and con-\ntent of the annual financial statements, including the\ndisclosures, and whether the annual financial state-\nments present the underlying transactions and events\nin a manner that the annual financial statements give\na true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial\nposition and financial performance of the Company in\ncompliance with German Legally Required Accounting\nPrinciples.\n\nEvaluate the consistency of the combined manage-\nment report with the annual financial statements, its\nconformity with German law, and the view of the\nCompany's position it provides.\n\nPerform audit procedures on the prospective infor-\nmation presented by the legal representatives in the\ncombined management report. On the basis of suffi-\ncient appropriate audit evidence, we evaluate, in par-\nticular, the significant assumptions used by the legal\n\n\n\nAnnual Financial Statemen\n\ntent Balan Income\n\njes-Benz Group AG\n\nNotes to the Financial\n\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n\nrepresentatives as a basis for the prospective infor-\nmation and evaluate the proper derivation of the pro-\nspective information from these assumptions. We do\nnot express a separate opinion on the prospective\ninformation and on the assumptions used as a basis.\nThere is a substantial unavoidable risk that future\nevents will differ materially from the prospective\ninformation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, includ-\ning any significant deficiencies in internal control that\nwe identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a\nstatement that we have complied with the relevant\nindependence requirements and communicate with\nthem all relationships and other matters that may rea-\nsonably be thought to bear on our independence, and\nwhere applicable, the actions taken or safeguards\napplied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged\nwith governance, we determine those matters that were\nof most significance in the audit of the annual financial\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our\nauditor's report unless laws or other legal regulations\npreclude public disclosure of the matter.\n\nOther Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic\nRendering of the Annual Financial Statements\n\nand the Combined Management Report Prepared\nfor Publication Purposes in Accordance with\nSection 317 paragraph 3a HGB\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with\nSection 317 paragraph 3a HGB to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the rendering of the annual\nfinancial statements and the combined management\nreport (hereinafter the “ESEF documents”) contained in\nthe file “mercedesbenzgroupag-hgb-2023-12-31-de.\nxhtml\" (SHA256 Hashwert:55a82cdd3e20d87d3889b\n78aa070b3dd8e072112bf17ea0e2a29c67a0a8bfe0e)\nmade available and prepared for publication purposes\ncomplies in all material respects with the requirements\nof Section 328 paragraph 1 HGB for the electronic\nreporting format (“ESEF format”).
