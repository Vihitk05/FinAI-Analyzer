Financial instruments Classification On initial recognition , a financial asset is classified as measured at : am ort ised cost ; debt investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ; equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ; or fair value through profit or loss .

This assessment is referred to as the solely payments of principal and interest test and is performed at an instrumental level . The Company âĢ Ļ s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows .

Ex pected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive , discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate . The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms . Loss allowances are measured on either of the following basis : âĢĶ 12 - month expected credit loss : expected credit loss that result from possible default events within 12 months after the reporting date ; and âĢĶ Lifetime expected credit loss : expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument . The Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses , except for the following which are measured as 12 - month expected credit losses : âĢĶ Bank balances , other financial assets and other rece iv ables for which credit risk ( i . e ., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument ) has not increased significantly since initial recognition . The Company has elected to measure loss allowances for trade rece iv ables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses . The Company applies a simplified approach in calculating expected credit losses . The Company does not track changes in credit risk , but instead recogn ises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date . The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience , adjusted for forward - looking factors specific to the debt ors and the economic environment . When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses , the Company considers reasonable and supportive information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort . This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis , based on the Company âĢ Ļ s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information . The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due . Page 23 of 43 </s>\n\n\n<s> TIT AN GL OB AL R ETA IL L . L .

The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk . At each reporting date , the Company assess es whether financial assets carried at am ort ised cost are credit - im pa ired . A financial asset is âĢ ĺ credit - im pa ired âĢ Ļ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have occurred . Loss allowances for financial assets measured at am ort ised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the asset . For financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income , the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income , instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset . Off setting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforce able right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis , or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously .

The management applies hedge accounting only if all of the following conditions are met : e There is formal designation and written documentation at the inception of the hedge ; e The effectiveness of the hed ging relationship can be measured reliably . This requires the fair value of the hed ging instrument , and the fair value or cash flows of the hed ged item with respect to the risk being hed ged , to be reliably measurable ; e The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving fair value or cash flow offsets in accordance with the original documented risk management strategy ; and e The hedge is assessed and determined to be highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the hedge relationship . A hedge is highly effective if changes in the fair value of the hed ging instrument , and changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the hed ged item attributable to the hed ged risk .

The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk . At inception of the hedge , the management design ates hedge either as a cash flow hedge or as a fair value hedge . The designation is done at inception of the hedge . At inception of the hedge , the management establishes formal documentation of the hedge relationship . The method an entity adop ts depends on its risk management strategy and hedge accounting systems and practices . The method that will be used in measuring hedge effectiveness is specified in the hedge documentation . The hedge documentation prepared at inception includes a description of the following : e Risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge ; e The nature of the risk being hed ged ; e Clear identification of the hed ged item the asset , liability , firm commitment or cash flows arising from a forecast transaction and the hed ging instrument ; and e How hedge effectiveness will be assessed both prospect ively and retrospect ively . The entity describes the method and procedures in sufficient detail to establish a firm and consistent basis for measurement in subsequent periods for the particular hedge . A hed ging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements if there is an economic relationship between the hed ged item and the hed ging instrument , the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from the economic relationship and the hedge ratio of the hed ging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantities of the hed ged item that the entity actually hed ges and the hed ging instrument used to hedge that quantity of hed ged item . In a fair value hedge , any in effect iveness is automatically recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because changes in the measurement of both the hed ging instrument and the hed ged item are reported through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except if the hed ging instrument hed ges an equity investment for which the management has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income . Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments , such as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at fair value at each reporting date . The Company also discl oses the fair value of financial instruments measured at am ort ised cost . The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date .

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value , maxim ising the use of relevant observable inputs and minim ising the use of unob serv able inputs . In addition , the fair value measurements are categor ised into Level 1 , 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurement are observable and significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety , which are described as follows : e Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices ( un adjusted ) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities . e Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ( i . e . as prices ) or indirectly ( i . e . derived from prices ). e Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data ( un ob serv able inputs ). 4 .

After the commencement date , the Company reass esses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise ( or not to exercise ) the option to renew . Discount ing of lease payments The lease payments are discounted using the Company âĢ Ļ s incremental borrowing rate ( âĢ ľ IB R âĢ Ŀ ), which ranges from 4 . 11 % to 6 . 40 %, due to the absence of implicit rates in the lease contracts .

Inventory provisions Management regularly undert akes a review of the Company âĢ Ļ s inventory , stated at A ED 238 , 135 , 89 2 ( pre vious year A ED 234 , 456 , 685 ) in order to assess the likely real isation proceeds , taking into account purchase and replacement prices , technological changes , age , likely obs olesc ence , the rate at which goods are being sold and the physical damage . Based on the assessment assumptions are made as to the level of provision ing required . Fair value of financial assets The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded on an active market are determined using valuation techniques . The Company uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period . The key assumptions used and the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in Note 3 ( s ).

This process of risk management is critical to the Company âĢ Ļ s continuing profitability . The Company âĢ Ļ s risk management foc uss es on actively securing short to medium term cash flows by minim ising the exposure to financial markets . The primary risks to which the business is exposed , which are unchanged from the previous year , comprise credit risks , liquidity risks and market risks ( including cash flow interest rate risks and fair value interest rate risks ). The management of the Company reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summar ised below : Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss . Credit risk is managed by assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers and the Potential for exposure to the market in which they operate , combined with regular monitoring and follow - up . The Company buys and sells goods and services in foreign currencies . Exposure is minim ised where possible by den om inating such transactions in US dollars to which the UAE Dir ham s is pegged .

C NOT ES TO THE FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S FOR THE YEAR END ED 31 MAR CH 2024 Financial assets that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally bank accounts , trade and other rece iv ables and amount due from related parties . The Company âĢ Ļ s bank accounts are placed with high credit quality financial institutions . B orrow ing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure that the Company ob tains the best available pricing , terms and conditions on its borrow ings . The management assess es the credit risk arising from trade and other rece iv ables and related parties taking into account their financial position , past experience and other factors . Based on the assessment individual risk limits are determined . At the reporting date , 99 % of trade rece iv ables was due from two customers ( pre vious year 58 % of trade rece iv ables was due from one customer ). At the reporting date , the Company âĢ Ļ s trade rece ivable balances are from customers engaged in similar business in which the Company operates . The Company uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade rece iv ables , which comprise a number of balances . Loss rates are calculated using a âĢ ĺ flow rate âĢ Ļ method based on the probability of a rece ivable progressing through successive stages of delinqu ency to write - off . Flow rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the following common credit risk characteristics âĢĶ - geographic region , age of customer relationship and type of product purchased . Based on the assessment , the management believes that no impairment provision is required under IF RS 9 . Liquid ity risk Liquid ity risk is the risk that the Company may encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds . The Company 's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mism atches of the m atur ities of financial assets and financial liabilities . The Company âĢ Ļ s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure , as far as possible , that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due , under both normal and stressed conditions , without inc urring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group âĢ Ļ s reputation . The Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities . The table below summar ises the m atur ities of the Company âĢ Ļ s und isc ount ed financial liabilities at the reporting date , based on contractual payment dates and current market interest rates .

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters , while optimizing the returns . Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the values of financial instruments will fluct uate because of changes in foreign exchange rates . There are no significant currency risks as substantially all financial assets and financial liabilities are den ominated in UAE Dir ham s or US Dollars to which the Dir ham is fixed . Reason ably possible changes to exchange rates at the reporting date are unlikely to have had a significant impact on profit or equity . Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluct uate because of changes in market interest rates . Bank overd raft and bank loan are subject to floating interest rates at levels generally obtained in the UAE or are linked to SO FR and are therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk . At the reporting date , if interest rates had been 1 % higher or lower , interest expense on variable rate debt would have been A ED 3 , 355 , 133 higher or lower ( pre vious year A ED 1 , 216 , 8 18 resulting in equity being lower or higher by A ED 3 , 355 , 133 ( pre vious year A ED 1 , 216 , 8 18 ). 29 .

In our opinion , the accompanying financial statements present fairly , in all material respects , the financial position of Black Sea Trade and Development Bank as at 31 December 2021 , and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IF RS s ). Bas is for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Aud iting ( IS As ) as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation . Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the âĢ ľ Aud itor 's Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements âĢ Ŀ section of our report . We have been independent of the Bank during the whole period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Account ants âĢ Ļ Code of Ethics for Professional Account ants ( IES BA Code ) as incorporated into Greek legislation and the ethical requirements in Greece relevant to the audit of the financial statements and we have fulfilled our ethical requirements in accordance with the applicable legislation and the above mentioned Code of Ethics . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . Em phasis of Matter We draw your attention to note 28 of the financial statements where it is described the negative impact of the geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and Russia , that begun in February 2022 , on the quality of some of the Bank âĢ Ļ s assets . Our report is not qualified in respect to this matter . Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that , in our professional judgment , were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year .

Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Ex pected Credit Loss on Loans at am ort ized cost Loans at am ort ized cost of the Bank amounted to EUR 2 , 329 million as at 31 December 2021 ( E UR 2 , 030 million as at 31 December 2020 ) and loss impairment to EUR 44 million ( E UR 56 million as at 31 December 2020 ) as presented on the Statement of Financial Position . The Bank measures Ex pected Credit Loss es ( EC L ) for loans at am ort ized cost both on an individual and a collective basis . The estimation of E CL on loans at am ort ized cost is considered a key audit matter as it is a complex calculation that involves the use of a number of assumptions and parameters such as probability of default ( PD ), Loss Given Default ( LG D ) and Exposure at Default ( E AD ) as well as assumptions around the inputs used and probability weight of the multiple economic scenarios . Significant Management jud gements also relates to the criteria used for the staging assessment of loans at am ort ized cost . Management provided further information about principles and accounting policies for determining the allowance for impairment on loans at am ort ized cost and the management of credit risk in notes 3 . 6 , 5 , 12 and 15 to the financial statements . Based on our risk assessment and following a risk based approach , we have evaluated the impairment method ologies applied and assumptions made by Management in relation to this key audit matter , which included , inter al ia , the following audit procedures : - we obtained an understanding of the procedures and evaluated the design and implementation of relevant internal controls within the business process . - we assessed the appropri at eness of the Bank âĢ Ļ s IF RS 9 impairment method ologies . - with the support of our internal financial risk modeling specialists we assessed the reason abl eness of Management 's assumptions and input data used in the model , including the analysis of the forecast ed macro economic variables . We tested the mechanical elements of the calculations such as the E AD , the PD and stage allocation and reper formed the calculation of the E CL on a sample basis . - we tested the accuracy and comple teness of critical data used in the E CL calculation by agreeing a sample of E CL calculation data points to source systems or documentation . - on as ample basis we assessed the reason abl eness of the estimated expected credit loss for the individually assessed credit impaired exposures . We assessed the adequ acy and comple teness of the Bank âĢ Ļ s disclosures in respect of credit risk , structure and quality of loan portfolio and impairment allowance in accordance with IF RS </s>\n\n\n<s> Del o itte . Respons ibilities of Management and Those Charg ed with Govern ance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IF RS s , and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material mis statement , whether due to fraud or error . In preparing the financial statements , Management is responsible for assessing the Bank âĢ Ļ s ability to continue as a going concern , disclosing , as applicable , matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquid ate the Bank or to cease operations , or has no realistic alternative but to do so . The Audit Committee of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial reporting process . Auditor âĢ Ļ s Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material mis statement , whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditor âĢ Ļ s report that includes our opinion . Re asonable assurance is a high level of assurance , but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with IS As , as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation , will always detect a material mis statement when it exists . Mis stat ements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if , individually or in the aggregate , they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements . As part of an audit in accordance with IS As , as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation , we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit . We also : e Ident ify and assess the risks of material mis statement of the financial statements , whether due to fraud or error , design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks , and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material mis statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error , as fraud may involve collusion , for gery , intentional o missions , misrepresent ations , or the override of internal control . e Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances , but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank 's internal control . e Eval uate the appropri at eness of accounting policies used and the reason abl eness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management .

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence , and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence , and where applicable , related safeguards . From the matters communicated with those charged with governance , we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters .

BAS IS OF PRE PAR ATION OF FIN ANC IAL STAT EMENT S 2 . 1 Bas is of Prepar ation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IF RS s ) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IAS B ). These financial statements for the year ended 2021 were submitted by the Management Committee to the Board of Directors ( Bo D ) for approval on 6 June 2022 and were approved for issuance on that date . Purs u ant to Article 23 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , these financial statements shall be subject to approval by the Board of Governors ( Bo G ) in their Annual Meeting to be held on 23 June 2022 . Bas is of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the below assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value : Debt investment securities at fair value through other comprehensive income ; Loans at fair value through profit or loss ; Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss ; Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income ; Der iv ative financial instruments ; and Plan assets . Functional and presentation currency The Bank âĢ Ļ s functional currency is the Euro ( E UR ) as defined by the European Central Bank ( EC B ). The Euro is most representative of the Bank âĢ Ļ s operations and environment as a significant percentage of the Bank âĢ Ļ s lending operations are in Euro , and the administrative expenses and capital expenditures are primarily den ominated and settled in this currency . The Bank âĢ Ļ s presentation currency is the EUR and values are rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated . Use of Estimates and Jud gments The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IF RS requires management to make judgments and use of estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Actual results may differ from those reported . Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis . </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements The areas where the Bank has applied judgement and used estimates and assumptions are : estimation of expected credit losses of loans , fair valuation of financial instruments not quoted in active markets , including O TC derivatives and certain debt securities , impairment of investment securities , estimation of retirement benefits obligation , and conting encies from litigation . The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the Note 4 . 2 . 2 Going Concern The Bank âĢ Ļ s Board of Governors considered the Bank âĢ Ļ s ongoing financial sustainability w nen approving the Bank âĢ Ļ s âĢ ľ Long Term Strategic Framework ( L TS F ) 2021 - 20 30 âĢ Ŀ in June 2021 , which reflects the Bank âĢ Ļ s prospects and the ways in which its shareholders would like it to evolve .

SIGN IFIC ANT ACC OUNT ING POL IC IES A summary of the Bank âĢ Ļ s accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are presented in this section . These policies are the same as those applied for the comparative period presented taking into account the amendments to standards which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IAS B ), which are further analyzed below : 3 . 1 Ad option of New and Am ended Standards ( IF RS ) New standards and amendments to standards which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IAS B ), applied on 1 January 2021 : I AS 1 : Present ation of Financial Statements I AS 1 sets out the overall requirements for financial statements , including how they should be structured , the minimum requirements for their content and overriding concepts such as going concern , the acc ru al basis of accounting and the current / non - current distinction . The standard requires a complete set of financial statements to comprise a statement of financial position , a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income , a statement of changes in equity and a statement of cash flows . Effective 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 20 23 . Earlier application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . I AS 8 : Accounting Policies , Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors I AS 8 is applied in selecting and applying accounting policies , accounting for changes in estimates and reflecting corrections of prior period errors . The standard requires compliance with any specific IF RS applying to a transaction , event or condition , and provides guidance on developing accounting policies for other items that result in relevant and reliable information . Changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors are generally retrospect ively accounted for , whereas changes in accounting estimates are generally accounted for on a prospective basis .

The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . I AS 12 : Income Taxes I AS 12 implements a so - called ' com pre hens ive balance sheet method ' of accounting for income taxes which recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an entity 's assets and liabilities . Differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities , and carried forward tax losses and credits , are recognized , with limited exceptions </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted .

The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is permitted . The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . e I AS 41 : Agriculture I AS 41 sets out the accounting for agricultural activity âĢĶ the transformation of biological assets ( living plants and animals ) into agricultural produce ( har vest ed product of the entity 's biological assets ). The standard generally requires biological assets to be measured at fair value less costs to sell . Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 , earlier application is permitted . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 . Early application is permitted .

When preparing the financial statements exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities den ominated in foreign currencies at year end are recognized in the income statement . Monetary assets and liabilities den ominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro at the exchange rate at the reporting date . The foreign exchange gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the am ort ized cost in Euro at the beginning of the year , adjusted for the effective interest , impairment and prep ay ments during the year , and the am ort ized cost in the foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year . Non - mon etary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction . Foreign currency differences are generally recognized in income statement except for foreign exchange differences on non - mon etary items which are at F VT OC I as equity investments which are recognized in other comprehensive income . The Bank uses the official exchange rates published for the EUR by the European Central Bank ( EC B ). The exchange rates used by the Bank at the financial position date were as follows . 31 December 31 December 2021 2020 = United States dollar 1 . 132 60 1 . 227 10 = Pound sterling 0 . 840 28 0 . 899 03 = Russian rub le 85 . 300 40 91 . 467 10 1 E UR = Azerbaijan man at 1 . 9 26 50 2 . 08 900 = Georgian l ari 3 . 50 400 4 . 023 30 = Armenian dram 5 42 . 61 000 6 41 . 11 000 = Romanian le u 4 . 949 00 4 . 8 68 30 3 . 3 Cash and Cash Equ ival ents For the purposes of the statement of cash flows , cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand , plac ements with other financial institutions and debt securities with m atur ities of three months or less from the financial position date . These are highly liquid assets that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in value due to the movements in market rates . 3 . 4 Recogn ition and Initial Measure ment , and D ere c ogn ition of Financial Instruments The Bank recognizes a financial asset or financial liability in its statement of financial position when it becomes a party to the contractual rights or obligations . 3 . 4 . 1 . Date of recognition Financial assets and liabilities , with </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 5 3 . 4 . 2 Date of de recogn ition The Bank de recogn izes a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset when ( i ) the contractual rights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire , ( ii ) loses control of the contractual rights that comprise the financial asset or a portion of the financial asset or ( i ) the Bank retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset , but has assumed the obligation to pay it in full without material delay to a third party under a âĢ ĺ pass through âĢ Ļ arrangement . The Bank de recogn izes a financial liability when a liability is extinguished , that is when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged , cancelled or expires . The evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership preced es the evaluation of the transfer of control for de recogn ition transactions . On de recogn ition of a financial asset , the difference between the carrying amount of the asset ( or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset de recogn ized ) and the sum of ( i ) the consideration received ( including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed ) and ( ii ) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OC I is recognized in income statement . Any cumulative gain or loss recognized in OC I in respect of equity investment securities designated as at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ( F VT OC I ) is not recognized in income statement on de recogn ition of such securities . Financial Assets The classification of financial assets defines how existing information is reflected in the financial statements . In particular , the valuation method and the impairment calculation are defined by this classification , which are based on criteria established by the Bank . 3 . 5 . 1 Classification and subsequent measurement The Bank class ifies a financial asset in its financial statements in one of the below three measurement categories : 1 . Financial assets measured at am ort ized cost ( AC ): this category includes each asset or group of assets for which the Bank 's business model constitutes its holding for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows . Financial assets are classified at AC only if both of the following criteria are met : - The objective of the Bank âĢ Ļ s business model is to hold financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows ; and - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding : The Bank includes in this category financial assets which are non - der iv ative with fixed or determin able payments and with fixed m atur ities meeting the above criteria . </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements F VT OC I debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses that arise from fluctuations in fair value recognized in OC I . Their fair value is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices . On de recogn ition cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OC I are re classified from OC I to income statement . Foreign exchange gains or losses and interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognized in income statement . All such financial assets are recognized on trade date . The Ex pected Credit Loss es ( EC L ) for debt instruments measured at F V OC I do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position , which remains at fair value . Instead , an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at am ort ized cost is recognized in OC I as an accumulated impairment amount , with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss . The accumulated loss recognized in OC I is recycled to the profit and loss upon de recogn ition of the assets . 3 . Financial assets ( equ ity instruments ) measured at F VT OC I , with no re class ification of gains or losses to profit or loss on de recogn ition . On initial recognition the Bank can make the irre voc able election , on an instrument - by - in strument basis , to designate investments in an equity instrument which are not held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquire r in a business combination , as a financial asset measured at F VT OC I . Those not elected , which are primarily listed , are measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ( F VT PL ). D ivid ends received are recorded in the income statement . After initial recognition at cost , these financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value with all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value ( real ized and unreal ized ), including foreign exchange gains and losses , recognized in other comprehensive income , and are not re classified to income statement . For those financial instruments there is no impairment assessment . The fair value for those not purchased from an active market is determined using accepted valuation techniques which use unob serv able inputs . These valuation techniques used are net asset value , when this is deemed to approximate fair value , and earnings - based val uations using comparable information and discount ing cash flows . The Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments are included in this category . All such financial assets are recognized on settlement date . 4 . Financial assets measured at F VT PL : this category includes financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be classified in any of the above categories as </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 5 . 2 Measure ment The Bank measures financial assets at fair value on initial recognition , as detailed above . In the event the Bank considers that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price , that difference is recognized as a gain or loss on initial recognition but only if the fair value is based on a requested active market price for identical assets or is based on a valuation technique using data solely from identified markets . In all other cases , the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognized in the income statement when the inputs become observable , or when the instrument is de recogn ized . Financial assets that are subsequently measured at either AC or debt instruments at F VT OC I , are subject to provisions for impairment . Based on the Bank 's credit policy , the Bank does not originate credit - im pa ired financial assets , nor does the Bank purchase credit - im pa ired assets , exception being those loans would be acquired at a deep discount . Financial assets are not re classified subsequent to their initial recognition , except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets . 3 . 5 . 3 Business model assessment The factor of the business model refers , amongst others , to the manner in which the Bank manages its financial assets by class ifying them in portfolios that are part of its business model . The adopted business model determines the source of revenue , as it arises from individual portfolios either through the collection of contractual cash flows or from the sale of financial assets or the combination of the above . The assessment of the business model reflects the Bank 's strategy under normal business conditions . The assessment is not affected by actions required in âĢ ĺ emer gency situations âĢ Ļ ( e . g .: liquidity needs , non - in herent capital requirements for credit risk , etc .). Also , Management decisions taken to comply with new regulatory guidelines are not included in the assessment . In general , the Bank has included the majority of its loan portfolios in the hold - to - collect business model . The assessment of a business model is made within the definition of operational objectives as defined by the Bank 's Management , as well as in the operational management of its assets . The assessment is effected at portfolio level rather than at individual asset levels . The Business Model applied to loan portfolio , treasury portfolio and equity investment portfolio is reass essed at each reporting period . The reass essment of the Business Model has been established in order to determine if evidence initially used has changed . The assessment process applied by the Bank through its business model , based on strategic objectives , </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 6 3 . 5 . 4 Loans Loans originated by the Bank , is where money is provided directly to the borrower . Loans are initially recorded at fair value , which is usually the net amount dis b ursed at inception including directly attributable orig ination costs and certain types of fees or commission ( e . g . synd ication commission , front - end , commitment fees and handling charges ) that are regarded as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the loan , and are subsequently measured at am ort ized cost using the effective interest rate method . The Bank class ifies in loan category bonds which are purchased with a view of a development impact and such purchases are performed based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan financing criteria and follow the thorough appraisal and approval process of the Bank . Such bonds at 31 December 2021 were a gross amount of EUR 294 , 330 thousand ( 2020 : EUR 267 , 588 thousand ). Management has concluded that presentation within loans present fairly the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial position . Loans that are designated as at F VT PL are recognized at a value arrived at by using a combination of discounted cash flow models . These models incorporate market data pertaining to interest rates , a borrower 's credit rating , and underlying assets . Where unob serv able inputs have been used , a sensitivity analysis has been included under âĢ ĺ fair value hierarchy âĢ Ļ described within the âĢ ĺ R isk Management âĢ Ļ section of this report . Imp air ment 3 . 6 . 1 Financial assets The Bank records an allowance for expected credit loss for all loans and loans rece iv ables , and other debt instruments held at am ort ized cost , together with off balance sheet items ( lo an commitments and financial guarantee contracts ). In this section , all referred to as âĢ ĺ financial instruments âĢ Ļ . Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IF RS 9 . i ) Cal culation of expected credit loss E CL s are a probability - weight ed average estimate of credit losses that reflects the time value of money . Upon initial recognition of the financial instruments in scope of the impairment policy , the Bank records a loss allowance equal to 12 - month E CL , being the E CL that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months . Sub sequently , for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk ( S IC R ) since initial recognition , a loss allowance equal to lifetime E CL is recognized , arising from default events that are possible over the expected life of the instrument . The expected credit losses are weighted on the basis of three macro economic scenarios ( ad verse , basic </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank calculates impairment losses on a portfolio basis , except for financial assets that are credit - im pa ired in which case they are calculated on an individual basis . The Bank applies three main components to measure expected credit losses which are a LG D , PD and E AD , and assigns general market scenarios for potential credit risk deterioration . There can be transfers of exposures from one stage to another , depending on whether there is a change in the credit risk of that exposure . Prob ability of default is an estimate of the like lin ood of default over a given time horizon . The Bank uses information obtained from the Global Emerging Markets ( G EM s ) database in order to assign LG D to its loan asset classes . G EM s is an International Financial Institution ( IF I ) wide initiative designed to pool default and recovery rates experienced by IF ls in emerging markets . Treasury asset classes derive their PD s from the assigning rating agency . LG D is an estimate of the loss arising on default . The Bank uses information obtained from the G EM s database to assign LG Ds to its lending asset classes , and treasury asset classes derive their LG Ds from the assigning rating agency . ii ) Basic parameters used for the calculation of expected credit loss The calculation of expected credit losses is based on the following parameters : e Prob ability of Default ( PD ) represents the probability that a debtor will default on his debt obligations either over the next twelve months or over the remaining maturity of his debt . In accordance with IF RS 9 , the Bank uses non - disc rim inatory point - in - time PD s that adjust to macro economic assumptions using the Ex pected Credit Loss . Â° Exposure at Default ( E AD ) is defined as the estimate of the exposure at a future default date , taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date , including repay ments of principal and interest , and und rawn commitments based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s own experience . e Loss Given Default ( LG D ) represents the extent of the loss that the Bank expects for exposures that are in default and is defined as the difference between the contractual cash flows and those that the Bank expects to collect , including collateral amounts . LG D , which is usually expressed as a percentage of the E AD , varies according to the category of the counter party , the category and priority of the claim , the existence of collateral and other credit enhancements . The Bank assigns credit rating to each loan at inception based on the internal score card method ologies for Financial Instit utions , Corpor ates or Project Finance and all loans are subject to </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements iii ) Significant increase in credit risk At each reporting date , the Bank assess es whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition . When making the assessment , the Bank compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and support able information , that is available without undue cost or effort , that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition . In order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since orig ination , and hence transition to Stage 2 , a combination of quantitative and qualitative risk metrics are used . All loans with at least a 3 - not ch downgrade in PD on the Bank âĢ Ļ s internal ratings scale since orig ination , all loans for which the contractual payments are overdue by between 31 and 90 days inclusive , as well as all loans placed on the âĢ ĺ watch list âĢ Ļ are transitioned to Stage 2 . For financial guarantee contracts , the date the Bank becomes a party to the irre voc able commitment is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purpose of assessing the financial instrument for impairment . In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contract , the Bank considers the risk that the specified debtor will default on the contract in line with the above determination for loans . Generally , there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit - impaired or an actual default occurs . The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is key in transferring an exposure from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and the respective change in the E CL measurement from 12 - month to lifetime E CL . iv ) Credit - im pa ired A financial asset is credit - im pa ired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred . Evidence that a financial asset is credit - impaired includes observable data about the following events : - Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower ; - A breach of contract , such as a default or past due event ; - The lender ( s ) of the borrower , for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower 's financial difficulty , having granted to the borrower a concession ( s ) that the lender ( s ) would not otherwise consider ; - It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorgan ization ; - The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements a . Qual itative Unlike liness to Pay ( UT P ) criterion : the Bank considers that the oblig or is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security . Below there are some elements that are taken as indications of unlike liness to pay ( in line with CR R ( Article 178 )). - The Bank puts the credit obligation on non - acc rued status . - The Bank recognizes a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure . - The Bank has filed for the oblig or 's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an oblig or 's credit obligation to the Bank , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries . - The oblig or has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the Bank , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries . b . Quant itative Past due criterion : the exposure is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to the Bank . Imp air ment losses for guarantees are recognized while a guarantee is in effect and the amounts are determined based on the level of utilization of the guarantee . The methodology is consistent to that of loan commitments , and such losses are included in âĢ ĺ Other liabilities âĢ Ļ . Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 1 and 2 . As the primary definition for credit - im pa ired financial assets moving to Stage 3 , the Bank applies the definition of default , and interest income is calculated on the net carrying amount for these financial assets only . If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after a write - down , the release ( i . e . reverse ) of the impairment is credited to the provision for impairment asset losses . Un w inding of the discount is treated as income and remaining provision is then reass essed . 3 . 6 . 2 Non - financial assets At each financial position date , the Bank reviews the carrying value of the non - financial assets and assess es whether there is any indication of impairment . If such indications exist , an analysis is performed to assess whether the book value of the specific assets can be recovered . The recover able amount is the higher amount between the fair value less costs of disposal and of the value in use ( as calculated from the net cash flows ). If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its recover able value , then an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement . 3 . 6 . 3 Reneg oti ated financial assets </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 7 Mod ifications occur when the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegoti ated or otherwise modified . Some modifications result in de recogn ition of the existing asset and recognition of a new asset with the difference recognized as a de recogn ition gain or loss , to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded , while other modifications do not result in de recogn ition . Mod ifications that result in de recogn ition are considered to be substantial modifications . A significant or substantial change is defined when the customer enters into a new loan contract ( i . e . completely new product and new pricing ) that has a different interest rate type , loan amount , term period ( tem porary term extension is excluded ), and / or customer ( e . g . from single customer to joint or change in one of the joint customer names ). A distressed restructuring is an indication of unlike liness to pay where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material ( change in the net present value of the asset by more than 10 %) forgiveness , or postp onement of either principal , interest or , where relevant fees . Dist ressed restructuring occurs when forb earance measures have been extended towards a debtor . Therefore , those for borne exposures where the forb earance measures are likely to result in a diminished financial obligation are classified as default ed . Rest ruct ured operations will be considered cured and normalized after two successful repay ments ( average of 6 months per repayment ) and could therefore be subject to a Stage movement . For loans that are modified the Bank recal cul ates the gross book value based on the revised cash flows on the financial asset and recognizes the profit or loss from the modification in income statement . The new gross book value is recal culated by discount ing the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate . 3 . 6 . 4 Write - offs According to the IF RS 9 ( B 5 . 4 . 9 ), the gross carrying amount of a financial asset may be directly reduced when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset in its entirety or a portion of it . As such , the Bank may record a write - off of Stage 3 loans . The Bank may also , on an ad - h oc basis , examine the need for any further write - offs of Stage 2 loans if there is relevant evidence . 3 . 6 . 5 Write - backs Recover ies ( write - backs ) of an asset , or part thereof , are credited to the income statement if previously written off . Financial Li abilities The Bank recognizes a financial liability in its financial statements at the </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 7 . 1 . B orrow ings B orrow ing transactions which are amounts due to financial institutions and debts evidence by certificates , are recognized in the statement of financial position at the time the funds are transferred to the Bank . They are measured initially at the fair value of the funds transferred , less any transaction costs . They are subsequently measured at am ort ized cost unless they qualify for hedge accounting in which case the am ort ized cost is adjusted for the fair value movements attributable to the to the risks being hed ged . Interest expense is accrued in the income statement within âĢ ľ Interest expense âĢ Ŀ using the effective interest rate method . 3 . 7 . 2 Other liabilities Other liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at F VT PL , are recorded at am ort ized cost . The amounts include accrued finance charges on borrow ings and other accounts payable . 3 . 8 Off setting of Financial Assets and Li abilities Off setting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements is permitted if , and only if , there is a currently enforce able legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis , or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously . 3 . 9 Der iv atives In the ordinary course of business , the Bank enters into various types of transactions that involve derivative financial instruments . A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract between two parties , where future payments are dependent upon movements in price in one or more underlying financial instruments , reference rates or indices . The Bank primarily makes use of derivatives for the below strategic purposes : - Many of the Bank âĢ Ļ s issued securities , excluding commercial paper , are individually paired with a swap to convert the issuance proceeds into the currency and interest rate structure sought by the Bank . - To manage the net interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks arising from all financial assets and liabilities . - Through currency swaps , to manage funding requirements for the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio . Der iv atives can include interest rate and cross currency swaps , forward foreign exchange contracts , interest rate future contracts , and options on interest rates and foreign currencies . Such financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position ( SO FP ) at fair value and are subsequently measured at their fair value . They are carried in the SO FP as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative . Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in the income statement . Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices to the extent publicly available , discounted cash flows and options pricing models as appropriate </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements All the Bank âĢ Ļ s interest rate or cross currency swaps are explicitly tied to a balance sheet asset or liability . Typically , the fixed rate on the swap and the matching asset or liability have the same characteristics ( term , payment dates etc .). Foreign exchange forwards ( pa ired purchases and sales of currencies on different dates ) of m atur ities typically less than three months are not tied to specific assets or liabilities . These are undertaken to manage sur pl uses and short falls in EUR and USD and are not undertaken for speculative purposes . All derivatives are documented under International Sw aps and Der iv atives Association ( IS DA ) master net ting agreement with Credit Swap Annex es ( CS As ) and marked to market and cash collateral ized daily . The Department of Treasury , under the guidance of A LC O and the supervision of the AL M unit , is responsible for the primary usage and managing interest rate and currency risks in the Bank âĢ Ļ s statement of financial position . The not ional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 14 . The fair value hierarchy level of derivatives is disclosed in Note 5 . 3 . 9 . 1 Der iv atives and hedge accounting The Bank design ates certain derivatives as hed ging instruments in respect of foreign currency rate and interest rate risk in fair value or cash flow hed ges . The bank does not apply fair value hedge accounting of portfolio of hed ges of interest rate risk . In addition , the bank does not use the exception to continue using I AS 39 hedge accounting rules , that is the Bank applies IF RS 9 in full . In accordance with its wider risk management , as set out in Note 5 , when a hed ging relationship meets the specified hedge accounting criteria , it is the Bank âĢ Ļ s strategy to apply either fair value or cash flow hed ges based on the exposure being hed ged . Transactions that are entered into in accordance with the Bank âĢ Ļ s hed ging objectives , but do not qualify for hedge accounting , are referred to in these financial statements as economic hedge relationships . At the inception of the hedge relationship , the Bank formally documents how the hed ging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria , by recording the economic relationship between the hed ged item and the hed ging instrument , the nature of the risk , the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge as well as the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hed ging relationship . Furthermore , both at the inception and on an ongoing basis ( at least on each reporting date or upon significant change , whichever comes first ), the Bank documents whether an </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements For the assessment of hedge effectiveness requirements and when measuring the hedge effectiveness / in effect iveness , the Bank uses qualitative and supplementary quantitative analysis where applicable . Sources of hedge in effect iveness between the hed ged items and hed ging instruments , can arise from : Differences in timing of cash flows . Different applied discount interest rate curves . Non - nil fair value of derivatives at the designation date . The effect of changes in counterpart ies âĢ Ļ credit risk on the fair values . The Bank discontin ues hedge accounting prospect ively only when the hed ging relationship ( or a part thereof ) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria ( after reb al ancing , if applicable ) or the hed ging instrument expires or is sold , terminated or exercised . The not ional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments designated are disclosed separately in Note 14 . Hedge accounting disclosures are provided in Note 5 . 3 . 9 . 1 . 1 Fair value hed ges App lying fair value hedge accounting enables the Bank to reduce fair value fluctuations of the recognized fixed rate financial liabilities as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates , thus hed ging the exposure that is attributable to interest rate risk / foreign currency risk and could affect reported earnings . The Bank only hed ges changes due to interest rates , such as benchmark rates , which are typically the most significant component of the overall fair value change . The Bank assess es hedge effectiveness by comparing fair value movements of the hed ging instruments and the hed ged items attributable to changes in these benchmark rates . For designated and qualifying fair value hed ges , the change in the fair value of the qualifying hed ging instruments is recognized in profit or loss whereas the carrying value of a hed ged item that is not already measured at fair value , is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hed ged risk in the statement of financial position ( âĢ ľ B orrow ings âĢ Ŀ ), with a corresponding entry in profit or loss . The Bank recognizes the hed ging gains or losses from the hed ging instrument in profit or loss , in the same line as the adjustment for the hed ged item ( âĢ ľ net fair value gains ( loss es ) on derivative instruments âĢ Ŀ ). Accordingly , any ineffective part is recognized immediately in profit or loss . Upon discontin uation of hedge accounting , the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hed ged item arising from the hed ged risk , is am ort ized to profit or loss from that date , based on how the hed ged item impacts profit or loss . If the hed ged item is de recogn ized , the un am ort ized fair </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements The amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is limited to the cumulative fair value hedge of the hed ged item from the inception of the Hedge less any amounts recycled to profit or loss . For assessing the hedge effectiveness , the hypothetical derivative approach is applied , which involves establishing a not ional derivative that would be the ideal hed ging instrument for the hed ged exposure ( i . e . swap with a zero fair value at inception of the hedge relationship with the same critical terms as the hed ged items ) and then use as a proxy for measuring hedge effectiveness , the comparison between the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the fair value of the actual hed ging instrument . Provided that the hed ged cash flows are no longer expected to occur , then the Bank immediately re class ifies the amount in the cash flow hedge reserve from OC I to profit or loss , however on hedge discontin uations , if the hed ged cash flows are still expected to occur , then the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is not re classified until the hed ged cash flows affect profit or loss . 3 . 10 Financial Guarant ees Iss ued financial guarantees are initially recognized at their fair value , being the premium ( fee ) received and subsequently measured at the higher of the un am ort ized balance of the related fees received and deferred , and the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the financial position date . The latter is recognized when it is both probable that the guarantee will require to be settled and that the settlement amount can be reliably estimated . Financial guarantees are recognized within other financial assets and other financial liabilities . 3 . 11 Property and Equipment Property and equipment include lease hold improvements and transportation and other equipment . Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost , which includes all costs that are required to bring an asset into operating condition . Sub sequently to initial recognition , property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses . Costs incurred subsequently to the acquisition of an asset , which is classified as property and equipment are capital ized , only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Bank beyond those originally anticipated for the asset , otherwise they are exp ensed as incurred . At each reporting date the Bank assess es whether there is any indication that an item of property and equipment may be impaired . If any such indication exists , the Bank estimates the recover able amount of the asset . Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recover able am ourt , it is written down immediately to its recover able amount .

These assets are am ort ized on a straight - line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives , which is software for desk tops of three years and software for servers of five years . At each reporting date , management reviews intangible assets and assess es whether there is any indication of impairment . If such indications exist an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is fully recover able . A write - down is made if the carrying amount exceeds the recover able amount . 3 . 13 Right of Use Assets Right - of - use assets comprise those assets that the Bank , as the les see , has control of the underlying assets during the term of the lease . Control is considered to exist if the Bank has : - The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset ; and - The right to direct the use of that asset . The Bank provides for the recognition of a right - of - use asset and a lease liability upon lease commencement in case that there is a contract , or part of a contract , that conve ys to the Bank the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration . More details are provided within the lease accounting policy Note 3 . 21 . 3 . 14 Tax ation In accordance with Article 52 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Bank , its assets , property , income and its operations and transactions are exempt from all taxation and all customs duties in all Member Countries . The Bank is also exempt from any obligation for payment , withholding or collection of any tax or duty . Also , no tax shall be levied on salaries or em ol uments paid by the Bank to employees . These tax exemptions are also included and elaborated upon in Article 12 of the Headquarters Agreement with the Hell enic Government , ratified by Greek Law 23 80 / No . 38 / 7 . 3 . 1996 . 3 . 15 Prov isions The Bank records provisions for present obligations and risks when the following circumstances exist ( a ) there is an existing legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events ( b ) for the obligation to be settled an out flow of resources embod ying economic benefits is present and ( c ) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made . 3 . 16 Share Capital and D ivid ends In accordance with Article 36 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Board of Governors shall determine annually what part of net income or surplus of the Bank from operations shall be allocated to </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 18 Income and Exp ense Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method . The effective interest rate ( E IR ) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument ( or , where appropriate , a shorter period ) to : - The gross carrying amount of the financial asset ; or - The am ort ized cost of the financial liability . When calculating the E IR for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit - im pa ired assets the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument , but not the E CL . For purchased or originated credit - im pa ired financial assets , a credit - adjusted E IR is calculated using estimated future cash flows including the E CL . The calculation of the E IR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate . Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability . i ) Am ort ized cost ( AC ) and gross carrying amount The AC of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repay ments , plus or minus the cumulative am ort ization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and , for financial assets , adjusted for any E CL allowance . The gross carrying amount of a financial asset âĢ Ļ is the AC of a financial asset before adjusting for any E CL allowance . ii ) Cal culation of interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement for all interest bearing instruments using the effective interest rate method . Interest income includes interest on loans and advances to customers , coupons earned on fixed income investment securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other instruments . Fees and direct costs relating to a loan orig ination or acquiring an investment security , financing or restructuring and to loan commitments are deferred and am ort ized to interest income over the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method . Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss , interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss . The E IR of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability . In calculating interest income and expense , the E IR is applied to the gross carrying amount of the </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 3 . 19 iii ) Fees and commissions Fee and commission income and expense that are integral to the E IR on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the E IR . Other fee and commission income âĢĶ including account servicing fees , investment management fees , sales commission , placement fees and synd ication fees âĢĶ is recognized as the related services are performed . If a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw - down of a loan , then the related loan commitment fee is recognized on a straight - line basis over the commitment period . A contract with a customer that results in a recognized financial instrument in the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements may be partially in the scope of IF RS 9 and partially in the scope of IF RS 15 . If this is the case , then the Bank first applies IF RS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of IF RS 9 and then applies IF RS 15 to the residual . Fee and commission income from contracts with customers under the scope of IF RS 15 is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer . The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a service to a customer . The adoption of IF RS 15 had no impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements as the execution and completion of the transaction requested by a customer is done at point in time , and this is consistent with the Bank âĢ Ļ s existing accounting policy . Other fee and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees , which are exp ensed as the services are received . iv ) Interest rate benchmark reform At present the Bank is continuing the usage of Lib or as the interest rate benchmark of which the Bank is exposed to , as there is uncertainty to the timing and precise form of the new benchmark that has yet to be finalized . The adoption will not have any material impact on the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . Staff Retirement and Termin ation Benefits The Bank has established a pension plan , where the fund âĢ Ļ s assets are held separately from the Bank âĢ Ļ s own assets , for all its eligible employees , consisting of three pillars : a . The first pillar is a defined post - employment benefit scheme financed entirely by the Bank . The scheme âĢ Ļ s funding level and the Bank âĢ Ļ s contributions are determined on the basis of actu arial val uations performed by qualified , independent actu aries on an annual basis at the end of each annual reporting period . The actu arial valuation uses the projected unit credit method and a number of financial and demographic assumptions . The most significant assumptions include age </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements C . The third pillar is a defined contribution scheme funded entirely by each employee , up to 40 % of basic salary and is not recorded in the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements . As an alternative , staff are entitled to retirement benefits from the Greek State Social Insurance Fund ( EF KA ), which is a defined contribution scheme . Current service costs in respect of both the pension plan ( a ) and ( b ) and EF KA are recognized as an expense in the period which they relate and are included in âĢ ĺ Person nel expenses âĢ Ļ . The Bank may offer termination benefits to employees that are separated based on the Bank âĢ Ļ s separation policy . These benefits , including indemn ities and any related retirement benefits , are recognized in income as an expense in the same period they are incurred . 3 . 20 Related Parties Related parties include entities , which the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence in making financial and operational decisions . Related par ities include key management personnel , and close family members of key management personnel . 3 . 21 Le ases âĢĶ the Bank as a L essee On 1 January 2019 the Bank adopted IF RS 16 , âĢ ĺ Le ases âĢ Ļ . This Standard has established the principles for the recognition , measurement and presentation of leases , and provides a single les see accounting model that is required at the commencement date of the lease . The objective is to report information that ( a ) faithfully represents lease transactions and ( b ) provides a basis for the amount , timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases . The Bank as a les see is required to recognize right - of - use assets ( represent ing the Bank âĢ Ļ s right to use the underlying leased assets ) and a lease liability ( represent ing the Bank âĢ Ļ s obligation to make lease payments ), in the statement of financial position . The Bank applied the practical exped ient in IF RS 16 to contracts that were identified as leases in order to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease , on transition to contracts that were previously identified as leases under I AS 17 and I FR IC 4 . Consequently , the Bank âĢ Ļ s leases are only for office space ; and does not lease land , corporate vehicles , or technical or IT equipment , nor does the Bank have any sale - and - lease back transactions . The Bank elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach , without rest at ement of comparative figures . Under this approach , the Bank was able to choose on a lease by lease basis to measure the right - of - use asset at the same amount as the lease liability .

SIGN IFIC ANT ACC OUNT ING J UD G EMENT S AND KEY SOU RC ES OF EST IM ATION UNC ER TAIN TY The preparation of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial statements requires Management to make jud gements , estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , income and expense and accompanying notes . Unc ertain ty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods . The Bank believes that the significant judgments , estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its condensed interim financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of the date of preparation . The most significant areas , for which critical judgments , estimates and assumptions are required in applying the Bank âĢ Ļ s accounting policies , are the following : a . Fair value estimates for financial s instruments carried at fair value . b . The Bank âĢ Ļ s method for determining the level of impairment of loan operations is described within the Accounting and further explained in Note 5 Risk Management âĢĶ credit risk section . In accordance with IF RS 9 , E CL represents the average credit losses weighted by the probabilities of default ( PD ), whereby credit losses are defined as the present value of all cash short falls . The E CL is calculated for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans by applying the provision rate to the projected exposure at default ( E AD ), and discount ing the resulting provision using the loan âĢ Ļ s effective interest rate ( E IR ). The provision rate is generated by multiplying the PD rate and the loss given default ( LG D ) rate applicable to the loan . A number of critical accounting estimates are therefore made in the calculation of impairment of loan operations as follows : Â° Crit eria used for staging assessment of loans and advances to customers . e Ass um ptions for future cash flows of individually assessed credit - im pa ired exposures . Â° The input and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple economic scenarios . For loans that are individually assessed which have a lifetime E CL and that are credit - impaired in Stage 3 , the impairment allowance results from the impairment test that is conducted on the basis of objective evidence obtained through a risk asset review process . An impairment test includes projected cash in - flows and out - flows , available for debt service until maturity , which are discounted at the original effective interest rate ( E IR ) to reach a net present value for a particular operation , less any collateral that can be realized . 33 </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 4 . 1 Cov id - 19 The continuation of the Cov id - 19 pand emic means that the Bank could face additional credit , market and operational risks . The duration of the pand emic is difficult to predict at this time , as are the extent and effectiveness of economic interventions by the governments and central banks in the region of the Bank âĢ Ļ s operations . The Bank continues to monitor the developments and to manage the risks associated with the Bank âĢ Ļ s various portfolios within existing financial policies and constraints . The two main areas that affect the Bank âĢ Ļ s judgement and estimates are : 1 . The Bank âĢ Ļ s equity investments which will likely see a reduced fair value due to the downward pressure , although the Bank has a small portfolio such investments , and therefore the Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability will not be materially impacted . 2 . The Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio due to business disruption that can occur in economic activity in the region will put pressure for borrowers , affecting those operating primarily in the service and consumer goods industries . This could likely force debt restructuring and an increase in defaults among less robust operations . The Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability could be impacted by a severe increase in E CL on performing loans , driven by worsening of the macro - economic outlook scenarios . With regard of the Bank âĢ Ļ s operational risk the information technology ( IT ) systems have proven they are stable , powerful and flexible , as the majority of the Bank âĢ Ļ s staff were working successfully remotely . The Bank is also investing in new IT infrastructure to expand digital and cloud transformation , as well as strengthening the Bank âĢ Ļ s cybersecurity and internal control systems . 34 </s>\n\n\n<s> Notes to the Financial Statements 5 . RIS K MAN AG EMENT The Bank âĢ Ļ s activities are subject to a variety of risks , some of which are not within the Bank âĢ Ļ s control : including risks relating to changes in interest rates , foreign exchange rates , declines in liquidity and deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolio . The Bank monitors and manages the m atur ities of its loans , its interest rate and exchange rate exposure , its liquidity position and the credit quality of each individual loan and equity investment in order to minimize the effects of changes in them relative to the Bank âĢ Ļ s profitability and liquidity position . The Bo D has approved risk management policies and guidelines that are delegated to the Management of the Bank for the identification and measurement of risk , as well as being subject to risk limits and controls . To manage risks the Bank has established an Asset and Li ability Committee ( AL CO ), a Credit Committee ( CC ) that implement the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit and lending policies , the Legal Affairs Department , the Risk Management Department and the Financial Analysis Department , which together are responsible for dev ising , implementing and monitoring the Bank âĢ Ļ s risk management policies , including financial , credit and market risks . The A LC O is responsible for monitoring and managing the Bank âĢ Ļ s overall asset and liability position in accordance with the Bank âĢ Ļ s treasury policies . It monitors and manages the Bank âĢ Ļ s liquidity position , maturity gaps , interest income and expense and the condition of the international financial markets and is responsible for assigning market risk limits . The A LC O consists of members of the Bank âĢ Ļ s Management and a member of the Treasury Department and has regular monthly meetings . The Credit Committee is responsible with respect to credit matters . Its key responsibilities include : approval of lending operations for submission to the Bo D for final approval , establishing specific parameters ( e . g . policies , limits , targets , guidelines ) for operational decision - making , approval of changes to the manuals that prescribe how operations are to be analyzed , approved , administered and monitored and approval of any amendments , restructuring and other operation - related matters . The Credit Committee consists of members of the Bank âĢ Ļ s Management , and has regular meetings as required to monitor and manage overall risk concentration by reference to borrower and industry exposure and critically reviews each individual loan and equity investment proposal made by the lending business areas . A major function of the Credit Committee is to minimize the credit risk presented by each individual loan and equity investment proposal , and the overall portfolio risk of the Bank .

The application of sound banking principles in the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit process seeks to ensure that the significant credit risks are properly identified and managed while other risks resulting from its activities are mit igated to the extent possible . Import antly , the Bank is recognized as an international financial institution , and as such can expect to benefit from the preferred creditor status custom arily and historically afforded to such institutions . This preferred creditor status serves to provide an additional layer of comfort against the risks of non - payment on sovereign debt or by private sector borrowers as a result of local laws creating a delay or freeze on foreign - currency exchanges . The Bank is exposed to the following risks discussed below . Financial Risk The Bank âĢ Ļ s exposure to financial risk is through its financial assets and financial liabilities including any rece iv ables from these financial assets . The key aspects of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financial risk are ( i ) credit risk ( ii ) liquidity risk and ( iii ) market risk . a ) Credit risk The Bank is subject to credit risk , which is the risk that customers or counterpart ies will be unable to meet their obligations as they fall due . Credit risk arises principally from the Bank âĢ Ļ s lending activities as well as other activities where the Bank is exposed to counter party default risk . Regular reviews by the departments of Risk Management , Financial Analysis and Project Implementation and Monitoring are conducted of all exposures within the lending portfolios , typically on a semi - ann ual basis , though exposures that are perceived to be more vulnerable to possible default are reviewed more frequently . At each review there is ( i ) an assessment of whether there has been any change in the risk profile of the exposure ( ii ) recommendations of actions to mitigate risk and ( iii ) recon f irming or adjusting the risk ratings , and for equity investments , reviewing of fair value . Where relevant , the level of the expected credit loss is evaluated and recon f irmed or adjusted . Responsibility for operations considered to be in jeopardy may be transferred from the original lending department to a corporate recovery team in order to most effectively manage the restructuring and recovery process .

Individual operations are further constrained by the Single Ob lig or Limit and by monitoring of Sect oral Exposure . a 6 . Coll ateral and credit enhancements The Bank mit ig ates credit risk by holding collateral and other credit enhancements against exposure to customers and counterpart ies where it believes such security is necessary . The Bank defines security as mechanisms , procedures and assets negotiated in transactions that are meant to protect it against loss in case of non - performance . Security includes , but is not limited to , material assets , financial instruments , guarantees , co venants and comfort letters . e Loans and advances . The Bo D approved guidelines for taking security under lending operations , set the levels and types of collateral and other credit enhancements recommended for a given risk profile . The main types of collateral that may be obtained by the Bank are : mortgages on properties and equipment , pledges of equity shares and investment instruments , assignment of rights on certain contracts , cash or blocked deposits and other third party guarantees . If necessary , the Bank reass esses the value of collateral in order to determine if additional collateral is needed to be provided by the borrower . At 31 December 2021 the secured portfolio was 55 . 8 % ( 2020 : 53 . 9 %) of the outstanding loans balance . e Other financial instruments . Coll ateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the instrument . Bonds and euro commercial paper held by the Bank as investment securities are generally un sec ured . The Bank may hold cash or government securities as collateral against its derivative contract counterpart ies . At 31 December 2021 the Bank had pledged as collateral for derivative transactions a net amount of EUR 14 , 150 thousand ( 2020 : EUR 3 , 320 thousand ). e For loans that are credit - im pa ired at the reporting date the Bank has collateral held as security , an amount of EUR 38 , 864 thousand to mitigate credit risk . The types of collateral with approximate values are real estate EUR 21 , 782 thousand , machinery and equipment EUR 6 , 175 thousand , and pledged shares EUR 10 , 9 07 thousand . b ) Liquid ity risk Liquid ity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank âĢ Ļ s financing and investment activities and in the management of positions .

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluct uate , favorably or unf avor ably , due to changes in market interest rates . The length of time for which the rate of interest is determined on a financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to that interest rate risk . The Bank âĢ Ļ s interest rate risk management activities aim to enhance profitability , by limiting the effect on asset values of adverse interest rate movements in order to increase net interest income by managing interest rate exposure . The majority of the Bank âĢ Ļ s loan portfolio is variable interest rate and the Bank has a policy aimed at minimizing interest rate mism atches between its assets and liabilities that seeks to ensure that the interest rate payment periods for its liabilities are matched as closely as possible to interest rate payment periods for the Bank âĢ Ļ s assets . As a matter of policy , the Bank does not take discretionary interest rate positions . The tables below provide information of the Bank âĢ Ļ s interest rate risk exposure on non - tr ading financial assets and liabilities . The Bank âĢ Ļ s assets and liabilities are included at carrying amount and categorized either on the contractual maturity date of the financial instruments ( including derivative financial instruments ) or , in the case of instruments that re - price to a market rate of interest before maturity , the next re - pr icing date as at the financial position date .

Hed ges of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk Fair value hed ges The Bank uses pay floating / re ceive fixed interest rate and cross - currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks , der iving from its issuance of both Euro and den ominated in foreign currencies debt ( main ly USD , AUD and R ON ). The Bank hed ges interest rate risk to the extent of the benchmark interest rate exposure of the floating leg ( main ly Eur ib or , USD Lib or ). Provided that the aforementioned exposures satisfy the hedge accounting criteria ( please see Note 3 . 9 . 1 ), these are designated in fair value hed ges . Upon designation , the fair value change on the qualifying hed ging instruments is recognized in profit or loss . Also , the change in fair value of the hed ged item attributable to the hed ged risk is recognized in the same line item in profit or loss . If the carrying amount of the hed ged item is not already measured at fair value ( me asured at cost or am ort ized cost ), then it is adjusted accordingly , with a corresponding entry . The Bank recognizes any ineffective portion of the fair value hedge relationships in profit and loss under the âĢ ľ Un real ized net fair value gains ( loss es ) on derivative instruments âĢ Ŀ line item . Upon hedge discontin uation , any hed ging adjustment made to a hed ged item for which the effective interest method is used , is am ort ized to profit or loss , by adjusting the effective interest rate from the date on which am ort ization begins . If the hed ged item is de recogn ized , then the adjustment is recognized immediately in profit or loss .

Purs u ant to Resolution 131 of the Bo G , that unanimously adopted the first amendment to the Est ablish ing Agreement , which became effective on 21 June 2013 . As of this effective date , and as per Resolution 131 of the Bo G , the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all of the Bank âĢ Ļ s authorized share capital was red en ominated from S DR to EUR . The conversion rate applied was S DR to EUR fixed at 1 : 1 . 15 . The share capital usage of the Bank is guided by statutory and financial policy parameters . Article 15 of the Est ablish ing Agreement limits the total amount of outstanding loans , equity investments and guarantees made for ordinary operations to 150 % of the Bank âĢ Ļ s unim pa ired subscribed capital , reserves and sur pl uses , establishing a 1 . 5 : 1 institutional gearing ratio . Additionally , dis b ursed equity investments shall not at any time exceed an amount corresponding to the Bank âĢ Ļ s total unim pa ired paid - in capital , sur pl uses and general reserve . The Bank determines required share capital as the potential losses the Bank may incur based on probabilities consistent with the Bank âĢ Ļ s credit rating . The main risk categories assessed under the share capital adequ acy framework are credit risk , market risk and operational risk , and such total risks are managed within the available share capital base that excludes call able share capital , while maintaining a prudent cushion . A main objective of this framework is to manage the Bank âĢ Ļ s share capital by providing a consistent measurement of capital head room over time . The Bank has no expectation for call able share capital to be called , and will prevent this need and use only available risk share capital as reserves , surplus and paid - in . At the 36 meeting of the Bo D in 2008 , the operational gearing ratio was set at 100 % of the Bank âĢ Ļ s unim pa ired paid - up capital , reserves and sur pl uses , and the usable portion of the call able capital .

Total impairment losses on loans was EUR 44 , 223 thousand in 2021 , a decrease of EUR 11 , 714 thousand compared to 2020 . The decrease in Ex pected Credit Loss ( EC L ) is mainly attributed to the stabilization of the Cov id - 19 pand emic , driven by modest improvements of macro economic variables used for some member countries as their economies bounced back from the Cov id - 19 pand emic . The increase amount in Stage 3 is due to the deterioration of a few loans reducing their carrying amount .

SH ARE CAP ITAL From the Bank âĢ Ļ s inception , and in accordance with Article 4 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , the Bank den ominated its authorized share capital in the Special Drawing Right ( S DR ) as defined by the International Monetary Fund ( IM F ). Resolution 131 of the Bo G unanimously adopted the requisite amendments to paragraph 1 of Article 4 and Articles 23 and 24 of the Est ablish ing Agreement , to expressly include among the exclusive powers of the Bo G the change of the unit of account of the Bank , and the red en omination of all capital stock of the Bank . These amendments to the Est ablish ing Agreement became effective on 21 June 2013 ( the âĢ ĺ Effective Date âĢ Ļ ). In accordance with such Resolution 131 of the Bo G as of the Effective Date the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and the authorized capital stock of the Bank was red en ominated into three billion four hundred and fifty million EUR ( 3 , 450 , 000 , 000 ), divided into three million ( 3 , 000 , 000 ) shares having a par value of one thousand and one hundred and fifty EUR ( 1 , 150 ) each , inclusive of all subscribed and un all ocated shares . Accordingly , as of the Effective Date , all outstanding share capital commitments of participating members in respect of their subscribed shares were converted into EUR . The authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased at such time and under such terms as may seem advisable . The Bank âĢ Ļ s capital stock is divided into paid - in shares ( fully paid and payable in installments ) and call able shares . Payment for the paid - in shares subscribed to by members was made over a period of years in accordance with Article 6 of the Est ablish ing Agreement for the initial capital raising purpose of the Bank , and as determined in advance by the Bank for capital increases ( in the only capital increase of the Bank so far , the structure of payments specified was similar to the one in Article 6 ). The same Article states that payment of the amount subscribed to in respect of the call able shares is subject to call only as and when required by the Bank to meet its obligations . Under Article 37 of the Est ablish ing Agreement any member may withdraw from the Bank by transmitting a notice in writing to the Bank at its Headquarters .

This subscription process followed a decision taken by the Bo G in December 2007 to triple the Bank âĢ Ļ s authorized capital to EUR 3 . 45 billion and to double the subscribed capital to EUR 2 . 3 billion , while leaving authorized capital of EUR 1 . 15 billion un all ocated .
